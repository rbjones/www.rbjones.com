This README file is very basic and at risk of getting out of date.
More comprehensive documentation is available on the X-Logic web site
at www.x-logic.org.
Documentation of the latest "release" of X-Logic can be found at:
  http://www.x-logic.org/arch/releases.html

The X-Logic source tree may be used to build all the X-Logic prototype
and demonstrator software and to build the X-Logic web site.

To do this straight from the sources you must take the following steps
in the x-logic directory:

	1.	autoconf
	2.	./configure
	3. 	make ibuild

The web site is not at this stage viewable, but must first be installed
by:

	4.	make install

The last stage must be done in whichever user has permission to write
to the installation directory which will depend on the autoconf defaults
unless it is overridden by parameter when configure is run.
Installation of the web site takes place to the "data" directory, which
on Linux is /usr/local/share.
The web site is designed to be browsable without being served, so you
can view it by opening /usr/local/share/x-logic/index.html as a file
in your browser.

To select other directories for installation it is best to set "prefix"

	2.	./configure --prefix path

e.g.:
	./configure --prefix /usr/local/rbj

then all the material destined for /usr/local/share/...  will go to
/usr/local/rbj/share/...

To select some other directory for installation of the web site use:

	2.	./configure --datadir directoryname
