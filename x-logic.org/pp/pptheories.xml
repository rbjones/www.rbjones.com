<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
Links to some of the theories which come with ProofPower, with brief descriptions.
These are the ones above "basic-hol" which is the point at which OpenMind hangs off the tree.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory min" href="min.html">
This theory introduces the primitive vocabulary for this variant of higher order logic.
There are just three constants and three type constructors.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory log" href="log.html">
The definitions of logical constants in terms of the primitive (undefined) constants.
The ones defined are those which are needed to state the axioms.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory init" href="init.html">
The five axioms for the primitive logic.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory misc" href="misc.html">
Miscellaneous low level definitions (local definitions, conditionals, unique existence) and theorems.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory pair" href="pair.html">
The theory of ordered pairs, including Curry and Uncurry.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory nat">
The theory of Natural numbers, but sorry, I have an unresolved technical problem webbing this one.
You can see it in the reference manual.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory list" href="list.html">
The theory of lists.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory char" href="char.html">
The theory of characters (of which there are only 256).
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory basic_hol">
This is a "cache" theory, which is a place were certain automatically generated theorems get stored, so the listing is not provided.
I mention it because it is a child of all the above, the highest point at which users can hang new theories, and the attachment point for OpenMind/X-Logic theories.
