<section title="Miscellany">
<abstract>
This is place for small bits of SML required by the rest of the tools for which I have not yet found a better home.

<subsec title="The XlTools exception">
The val "sundry" is declared because SMLNJ compilation manager doesn't get the dependency analysis correct if you have a structure which only contains an exception.
<ft lang="xl-sml">
structure XlTools =
  struct
    exception XlTools of string
    fun id x = x
  end

<section title="CM File">
<abstract>
A CM file is provided for building the X-Logic tools as a library under SML/NJ.

<subsec title="cm file for xltools">
At present a "group" is used rather than a "library".
The difference is that a library declaration requires an explicit list of what is to be exported and nothing else is then made visible when the library is loaded.
Maintaining such a list is not worthwhile at this early stage in the work.
