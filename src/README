$Id: README$

This is the README file for the www.RBJones.com web site source files.
From these source files the web site is built.

For full documentation on how to use this software please refer to the
RBJones.com website.

To build the site under Linux from the git sourcetree,
the following instructions will suffice:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install

The first step is not necessary if your source tree comes with a "configure" script pre-prepared.

However, success depends on there being already installed on the build machine a variety of other software.
The configure script makes a rather pathetic attempt at detecting whether this software is present, and reports on any discrepancies which it finds.

There follow some more detailed prescriptions for different environments.

To install ProofPower
---------------------

[
sudo apt-get install emacs git

git clone https://github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com.git
git clone https://github.com/RobArthan/pp.git
]

sudo apt-get install g++ libmotif-dev \
	polyml \
	libpolyml-dev \

tar xfz OpenProofPower-3.1w7.tgz
cd OpenProofPower-3.1w7
patch -p1 -b -B orig <../../ubuntu1604-patch.txt
./configure
install
export PPHOME=~/pp
export PATH=$PPHOME/bin:$PATH
cd
ln -s pp/app-defaults
cd ~/src/pp
curl http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/examples/maths_egs/PPMathsEgs-3.1.tgz >PPMathsEgs-3.1.tgz

cd PPMathsEgs-3.1/src
make -f maths_egs.mkf bld
make -f maths_egs.mkf pdf
cp maths_egs.polydb $PPHOME/db

if installing proofpower from the github repo for development work you would also need:

sudo apt-get install transfig groff

but a development build is different to the above and you need to follow the instructions in the repo.

Install rbjones.com:
--------------------
sudo apt-get install perl
sudo apt-get install latex2html
sudo apt-get install emacs splint groff
sudo apt-get install autoconf dos2unix git
sudo apt-get install default-jre

cpan install XML::DOM

download saxonHe zip file from sourceforge to ~/src/saxon/saxon9he/saxon9he.zip
unzip saxon9he.zip
export CLASSPATH=~/src/saxon/saxon9he/saxon9he.jar

cd
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com

cd www.rbjones.com/x-logic.org

=====================
Building in the cloud
=====================

I am trying to export my development system into the amazon EC2 (elastic cloud).
Here are my notes on how to do it:

1. make an instance of the Amazon Linux AMI
2. launch instance and connect to it using SSH
   (you will need to make a keypair to do this)
3. install the prerequisites for ProofPower as follows:

sudo yum install \
   gcc-c++ \
   texlive-latex \
   libXp-devel \
   libXext-devel \
   libXmu-devel \
   libXt-devel \
   xorg-x11-fonts-misc \
   openmotif \
   openmotif-devel

4. get PolyML (or some other ML) and install it
   (this is not in the amazon repostories, though possibly
    you can get it with yum from some other repository)

5. get ProofPower and install ProofPower
6. at this point I used yum to install the Development Tools
   and Development Libraries groups and also x11-X???
7. Looking for software to support remote X11 connection
   trying LibVNCServer-0.9.9
   Should install libjpeg-turbo


6. get MathsEgs and build with ProofPower, move the database to ~/pp/dbs


Eventually this came up against the need for X11  and gnome which are not in the amazon yum repositories, but are available by apt-get.
Cue switch to Ubuntu image/

Building under Ubuntu 12.04 (still AWS)
=======================================

login as ubuntu, not root.

following: http://dotnetrehab.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/vnc-on-ubuntu-feisty.html

apt-get update

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core xserver-xorg gnome-desktop-environment 

(that's a lot of software and takes a while to install)

sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
vncserver
(New 'X' desktop is ip-10-245-186-179:1)

========================================
BUILDING on MAC OS X El Capitain 10.11.4
========================================

[Never got this to work fully, but ProofPower is OK]]

sudo apt-get install

First Install ProofPower and its prerequisites.

From the App Store install Xcode.

Then install Xcode command line executables by:

xcode-select --install
(and select "install" when prompted) 

install XQuartz from XQuartz.org
install macports from macports.org

You need in your PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin
The MacPorts installation edits your .profile to make that happen, which has the desired effect if you are using Terminal.
If you are using emacs it doesn't (not with the out-of-the-box emacs), but if you copy .profile to .emacs_bash that does it).

To install openmotif you have to re-install xorg-libnXt because it needs the flat_namespace option.

sudo port install xorg-libXt +flat_namespace

sudo port install openmotif
sudo port install polyml
sudo port install texlive
sudo port install mkfontdir

Get ProoPower from Lemma-one.com and unpack tarball.

You will also need to get the most recent imp096.doc from github if you are on the latest macos, and replace the earlier versions in src/pptex and src/xpp

In the main directory,

export PPDOCFORMAT=PDF
PPPOLYLINKFLAGS=" " ./configure
./install

download maths_egs from Lemma-one, build and copy db to $PPHOME/db

(of course you may want to set other variables as well to change the default)

========================================
BUILDING on MAC OS X Mojave 10.14.6
========================================

First Install ProofPower and its prerequisites.

I installed tex from texlive, not using macports.
Also installed homebrew.

brew install git
    
Install Xcode from app store.
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app

Install macports by downloading MacPorts-2.5.4-10.14-Mojave.pkg
install XQuartz from XQuartz.org (2.7.11)

You need in your PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:

The MacPorts installation edits your .profile to make that happen, which has the desired effect if you are using Terminal.
If you are using emacs it doesn't (not with the out-of-the-box emacs), but if you copy .profile to .emacs_bash that does it).

Also, for texlive, put /Library/TeX/texbin In PATH

brew install polyml
==> Pouring polyml-5.8.mojave.bottle.tar.gz

OpenMotif has to be compiled from source to incorporate Rob's patch.

To install openmotif you have to re-install xorg-libXt because it needs the flat_namespace option.

sudo port install xorg-libXt +flat_namespace
sudo port install mkfontscale
brew install fig2dev

I patched openmotif-2.3.8 but ot failed to build, so I just installed openmotif-2.3.8 using brew (hence, not patched.
That Motif was not picked up during installation so I uninstalled it and installed with port, which seemed to work better.

sudo port install openmotif

Clone ProofPower from github.
checkout branch utf8

Edited dev_env to include /Library/TeX/texbin in PATH.
. dev_env in pp
make rebuild in pp/src

Make release.
(make_rel -v $PPVER in pp/tools)

Install release.

Go to pp/rel/***release dir***

export PPHOME=~/pp

./configure
WARNING: Motif installation not found
./install

download maths_egs from Lemma-one, build and copy db to $PPHOME/db

For building rbjones.com
------------------------

=========================================================================

2023 build on macOS Big Sur 11.7.2 (don't ask why the old version as of 2023).
==============================================================================

As I look at this once more having not migrated the whole process for years, the situation is complicated by the fact that the rbjones.com website build from scratch will no longer work with any issued version of ProofPower, since it is now dependent on the utf8 enhancements to ProofPower which have never been released.
So the build of rbjones.com depends on building ProofPower from the git sources using the utf8 branch.

These notes therefore relate to work in progress in trying to re-instste a build on an old MacBook, and I have no idea whether I will get very far with this.

Install Xcode

In terminal

sudo xcode-select --install

Download
https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases/download/v2.8.0/MacPorts-2.8.0-11-BigSur.pkg
Then install the package.

In new terminal: port version

sudo port install emacs-app

Warnings because command line tools not installed!
Emacs seems OK.
