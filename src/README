$Id: README$

This is the README file for the www.RBJones.com web site source files.
From these source files the web site is built.

For full documentation on how to use this software please refer to the
RBJones.com website.

To build the site under Linux from the git sourcetree,
the following instructions will suffice:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install

The first step is not necessary if your source tree comes with a "configure" script pre-prepared.

However, success depends on there being already installed on the build machine a variety of other software.
The configure script makes a rather pathetic attempt at detecting whether this software is present, and reports on any discrepancies which it finds.

There follows just one detailed working prescription, which is for building under Ubuntu 16.04 on VirtualBox, together with some incomplete notes on possible cloud builds.

=============================
Ubuntu 16.04.01 on VirtualBox
=============================

To install ProofPower
---------------------
sudo apt-get update

[
sudo apt-get install emacs git
cd
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com.git
git clone https://github.com/RobArthan/pp.git
]

sudo apt-get install g++ libmotif-dev \
	polyml \
	libpolyml-dev \
	texlive-latex-recommended

cd
mkdir src
cd src
get ubuntu1604-patch.txt and put it here
mkdir pp
cd pp
curl http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/getting/versions/OpenProofPower-3.1w7.tgz >OpenProofPower-3.1w7.tgz 
tar xfz OpenProofPower-3.1w7.tgz
cd OpenProofPower-3.1w7
patch -p1 -b -B orig <../../ubuntu1604-patch.txt
./configure
install
export PPHOME=~/pp
export PATH=$PPHOME/bin:$PATH
cd
ln -s pp/app-defaults
cd ~/src/pp
curl http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/examples/maths_egs/PPMathsEgs-3.1.tgz >PPMathsEgs-3.1.tgz
tar xfz PPMathsEgs-3.1.tgz
cd PPMathsEgs-3.1/src
make -f maths_egs.mkf bld
make -f maths_egs.mkf pdf
cp maths_egs.polydb $PPHOME/db

if installing proofpower from the github repo for development work you would also need:

sudo apt-get transfig groff

but a development build is different to the above and you need to follow the instructions in the repo.

Install rbjones.com:
--------------------
sudo apt-get install perl
sudo apt-get install latex2html
sudo apt-get install emacs splint groff
sudo apt-get install autoconf dos2unix git
sudo apt-get install default-jre

cpan install XML::DOM

download saxonHe zip file from sourceforge to ~/src/saxon/saxon9he/saxon9he.zip
unzip saxon9he.zip
export CLASSPATH=~/src/saxon/saxon9he/saxon9he.jar

cd
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/rbjones/www.rbjones.com

cd www.rbjones.com/x-logic.org
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/home/rbj
make ibuild

export PATH=/home/rbj/bin:$PATH

cd ..
autoconf
./configure --prefix=/home/rbj
make

=====================
Building in the cloud
=====================

I am trying to export my development system into the amazon EC2 (elastic cloud).
Here are my notes on how to do it:

1. make an instance of the Amazon Linux AMI
2. launch instance and connect to it using SSH
   (you will need to make a keypair to do this)
3. install the prerequisites for ProofPower as follows:

sudo yum install \
   gcc-c++ \
   texlive-latex \
   libXp-devel \
   libXext-devel \
   libXmu-devel \
   libXt-devel \
   xorg-x11-fonts-misc \
   openmotif \
   openmotif-devel

4. get PolyML (or some other ML) and install it
   (this is not in the amazon repostories, though possibly
    you can get it with yum from some other repository)

5. get ProofPower and install ProofPower
6. at this point I used yum to install the Development Tools
   and Development Libraries groups and also x11-X???
7. Looking for software to support remote X11 connection
   trying LibVNCServer-0.9.9
   Should install libjpeg-turbo


6. get MathsEgs and build with ProofPower, move the database to ~/pp/dbs


Eventually this came up against the need for X11  and gnome which are not in the amazon yum repositories, but are available by apt-get.
Cue switch to Ubuntu image/

Building under Ubuntu 12.04 (still AWS)
=======================================

login as ubuntu, not root.

following: http://dotnetrehab.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/vnc-on-ubuntu-feisty.html

apt-get update

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core xserver-xorg gnome-desktop-environment 

(that's a lot of software and takes a while to install)

sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
vncserver
(New 'X' desktop is ip-10-245-186-179:1)

===========================================

BUILDING on MAC OS X El Capitain 10.11.4
========================================

[Never got this to work fully, but ProofPower is OK]]

sudo apt-get install

First Install ProofPower and its prerequisites.

From the App Store install Xcode.

Then the install Xcode command line executables by:

xcode-select --install
(and select "install" when prompted) 

install XQuartz from XQuartz.org
install macports from macports.org

You need in your PATH /opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin
The MacPorts installation edits your .profile to make that happen, which has the desired effect if you are using Terminal.
If you are using emacs it doesn't (not with the out-of-the-box emacs), but if you copy .profile to .emacs_bash that does it).

To install openmotif you have to re-install xorg-libnXt because it needs the flat_namespace option.

sudo port install xorg-libXt +flat_namespace

sudo port install openmotif
sudo port install polyml
sudo port install texlive

Get ProoPower from Lemma-one.com and unpack tarball.

In the main directory,

PPPOLYLINKFLAGS=" " ./configure
./install

(of course you may want to set other variables as well to change the default)
