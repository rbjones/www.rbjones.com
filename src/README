This is the README file for the www.RBJones.com web site source files.
From these source files the web site is built.

For full documentation on how to use this software please refer to the
RBJones.com website.

To build the site under Linux from the CVS sourcetree,
the following instructions will suffice:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install

The first step is not necessary if your source tree comes with a "configure" script pre-prepared.

However, success depends on there being already installed on the build machine a variety of other software.
The configure script makes a rather pathetic attempt at detecting whether this software is present, and reports on any discrepancies which it finds.
