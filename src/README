This is the README file for the www.RBJones.com web site source files.
From these source files the web site is built.

For full documentation on how to use this software please refer to the
RBJones.com website.

To build the site under Linux from the CVS sourcetree,
the following instructions will suffice:

autoconf
./configure
make
make install

The first step is not necessary if your source tree comes with a "configure" script pre-prepared.

However, success depends on there being already installed on the build machine a variety of other software.
The configure script makes a rather pathetic attempt at detecting whether this software is present, and reports on any discrepancies which it finds.

Building in the cloud
=====================

I am trying to export my development system into the amazon EC2 (elastic cloud).
Here are my notes on how to do it:

1. make an instance of the Amazon Linux AMI
2. launch instance and connect to it using SSH
   (you will need to make a keypair to do this)
3. install the prerequisites for ProofPower as follows:

sudo yum install \
   gcc-c++ \
   texlive-latex \
   libXp-devel \
   libXext-devel \
   libXmu-devel \
   libXt-devel \
   xorg-x11-fonts-misc \
   openmotif \
   openmotif-devel

4. get PolyML (or some other ML) and install it
   (this is not in the amazon repostories, though possibly
    you can get it with yum from some other repository)

5. get ProofPower and install ProofPower
6. at this point I used yum to install the Development Tools
   and Development Libraries groups and also x11-X???
7. Looking for software to support remote X11 connection
   trying LibVNCServer-0.9.9
   Should install libjpeg-turbo


6. get MathsEgs and build with ProofPower, move the database to ~/pp/dbs


Eventually this came up against the need for X11  and gnome which are not in the amazon yum repositories, but are available by apt-get.
Cue switch to Ubuntu image/

Building under Ubuntu 12.04 (still AWS)
=======================================

login as ubuntu, not root.

following: http://dotnetrehab.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/vnc-on-ubuntu-feisty.html

apt-get update

sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install x-window-system-core xserver-xorg gnome-desktop-environment 

(that's a lot of software and takes a while to install)

sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
vncserver
(New 'X' desktop is ip-10-245-186-179:1)

=================================================
building on Ubuntu 12.04

required software:

sudo apt-get install latex \
     	     	     libXp-dev \
		     libXext-dev \
		     libXmu-dev \
		     libXt-dev

The following don't work:

sudo apt-get install xorg-x11-fonts-misc
sudo apt-get install openmotif
sudo apt-get install openmotif-devel
