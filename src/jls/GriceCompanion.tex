\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Bio}

J. L. Speranza is an Italian born in the pampas who has dedicated his life  
so far to Gricing this and that. He holds (in the wall of his room) a 
doctorate  from the University of Buenos Aires on Grice -- "Pragmatica Griceana". 
(This, he  regrets, while recognised by Western Educational Services 
alright -- has been  translated as "Grecian Pragmatics" -- but he don't (sic) 
mind.  He has  written extensively, but more recently, spoken extensively on 
matters Gricean at  the Grice Club which he created just to annoy Dan Sperber.  
Etc.

\section{Various Notes}

\paragraph{Frege}

--- The connection between Grice and Frege is only recently being  
developed, mainly due to efforts by Beaney and L. Horn. Much of the subtler  
writings by Frege on 'tone', 'colour' and 'force' can be given proper Gricean  
interpretations.
 
--- Frege was of course one of the inspiring models for Carnap. For  Grice 
the Frege influence came much later. There is one single ref. to Frege by  
Grice in his "Prejudices and Predilections" and this only in connection with 
the  idea of the Fregean 'sense' -- he writes, "in something like a Fregean 
sense".  Grice is considering, however, one of his 'metaphysical' routines. 
His Humean  projection is supposed to deliver concepts alla Fregean senses. 
E.g. the concept  of negation, the concept of value, the concept of -- you 
name it.
 
\paragraph{Kant}

--- The influence of Kant on Grice was a later one. As an Oxonian, Kant was 
 not really taken too seriously. In this respect, Carnap's education was 
more  traditionally philosophical (His PhD which Grice never attained, was 
published  in Kant Studien). Grice first came to the proximities of Kant via 
Abbott's  translation, and thus he was more of a minor Kantian than Carnap 
was, who could  savour Kant in the vernacular! -- In 1966, Sir Peter Strawson, 
Grice's former  student, published his "Bounds of Sense" which brought Kant 
to the Oxonian map.  Grice will later be invited to deliver the Kant 
Lectures at Stanford.
 
  Religion and Morality
During this period  Carnap gradually came to 
disbelieve in God, without being aware of any change in  his beliefs on moral 
questions. 

\paragraph{Grice}
 
Note. Grice's religious inclinations are harder to pin down. Chapman in  
fact sounds rather authoritative when she states that "Grice lost all faith by 
 the age of 19" or something. You can never be so sure. Chapman redeems 
herself  by noting the very many religious references, eschatological and 
Biblical, in  Grice's various writings.
 
--- While a disbeliever in God, Grice liked to play God. Borrowing on  
this idea by Carnap of pirots which karulize elatically, Grice founds a full  
programme in the vein of the ideal-observer. What we would do, as God, to 
secure  the survival of pirots. While not religious in nature, it has a 
religious tone  that is absent in the writings of Carnap in any respect.
 
\paragraph{Carnap}

Carnap fought in the Great War. Grice in the 'phoney' one. Grice's father  
was operative during the Great War when Carnap fought. Grice's father was a  
businessman -- a rather poor one. He invented a contraception that was good 
 during the Great War but found useless in the aftermath. In 1939 Grice 
joined  the RN and fought the Germans in mid-Atlantic theatre of operation. He 
was  transferred to Admiralty in London in 1942. 
 
--- Carnap possibly acquired some pessimism after the Great War. After all, 
 the Germans lost. This contrasts with the strange optimism felt by the  
Brits in the post-war period. Grice included. They were grown up, they had 
been  forced to grow up too soon. Yet they had not been able to develop their  
philosophical talents. Now in their thirties, a whole generation had been  
devastated. They had no time to lose. Grice's efforts were directed at the  
formation of a new generation of philosophers at Oxford -- along with his  
current fare of unappointed tuttees. Strawson was Grice's favourite student, 
and  the one which gave some sense to his rambling life. At the senior level, 
the  influence of Austin was paramount.
 
etc

"He then continued his work in logic and philosophy under  the inspiration 
of Frege and Russell, working on early versions of his books  Abriss der 
Logistik a logic text based on Principia Mathematica" in  the wiki ref.
 

\paragraph{Russell}
 
Russell has to be the lingua franca Carnap/Grice. Russell's influence on  
Carnap, which was actually two-way, was invaluable. Carnap was the Russelian 
par  excellence. The influence of Russell on Grice is much more roundabout. 
Grice got  an interest in Russell's modernism, as he calls it, after 
Strawson had  challenged it in Intro to logical theory (1952), which was as 
influential in  Oxford as Carnap's Intro to Semantics had been in the USA.
 
---
 
FL   vs   NL
 
Grice is clear in the ideology behind this.
 
There's what he calls
 
   Modernism
 
and Neo-Modernism
 
This is Russell and the heirs of PM
 
  -- this INCLUDES, almost by antonomasia, CARNAP.
 
----
 
Then there's
 
  neo-Traditionalism
 
  and earlier, Traditionalism
 
  By this Grice means Aristotelian logic (made respectable by  Lukasiewicz)
  and Strawson's and indeed Oxonian ordinary-language philosophical  logic.
 
  -- the idea that '\&', 'v', --$>$ -- the connectives in the  syntax of FL
  do not correspond to the vernaculars of NL 'and', 'or', 'if'.
 
  vide Carnap on this for a formalist (vs informalist) view.
 
 
 
--- 

NOTE: Grice came to prefer the modernism-traditionalism  distinction to his 
earlier formalim-informalism. The important thing here is not  so much the 
labels for these sorts of betes noires, but Grice's own brand: the  way he 
saw or presented himself "in society" -- and what he called the  longitudinal 
history of philosophy: "a foot in each camp", he jokes. But in  essence, 
that's the aptest description of his position. For his System G--  complete 
with a pragmatics, allows to maintain that the alleged divergences  between 
NL and FL are a matter of 'implicature' rather than logical form. 
 
Influences
"The men who had the strongest influence on my philosophical  thinking were 
Frege and Russell." 
 
---you write on your wiki thing.
 
For Note.

While Carnap would write, "The men who had the strongest  influence on my 
philosophical thinking were Frege and Russell" in that order,  Grice could be 
more irreverent. A 1913-born man finds the strongest influence in  a 
linguist born in the 1930s: Noam Chomsky and the Vienna Circle refugee: Quine.  --"
I have to admit" Grice writes (or words), that what "I admired in them is  
their method -- never their ideas, which I never respected, really". Grice's 
 choice is particularly agonistic: in the sense that it provokes sheer 
agony in  us: "for I never ... over the fact that these two genii never agreed 
ON  ANYTHING".
And they lived so close!
 
 
\paragraph{Dialogue}

Dialogue
Much of the stimulus came from discussions with other  philosophers.
you write on your thing.
 
--
 
Note.

The diagogic. Further to the gladiatorial and the conversational, it is  
worth pointing out that the later Grice grew less and less tolerant of 
'epagoge'  and more and more embracing of diagoge. The distinction is Aristotelian, 
but  Grice's twist reminds one of Carnap's pro-attitude for dialogue as  
stimulating.
 
Grice's father had been a musician and so was his younger brother Derek.  
The trios they engaged in in Harborne gave Grice a rich ... (thing) about the 
 value of cooperation: "Getting together to do philosophy should be like 
getting  to play music".
 
---
The epagoge/diagoge distinction is a basic one for Grice's metaphysical  
methodology. If evidence is, as the neo-Kantian he was, all too clearly  
necessary, one would hope however that the BASIS for this or that metaphysical  
claim (or rejection) should rest on its own virtues rather than on the 
success  or failure of having confronted its antithesis.
 
etc. 
 
re the vienna circle as forum for open discussion.
 
"The Carnap Circle" -- by this we mean the Carnap convivial approach to  
philosophy. This is echoed in the Grice Circle. Grice could only work  
philosophically in convivial conditions. Although he never belonged to the early  
Austin club, he was a regular, indeed, Austin's favourite member of Austin's  
playgroup. On Austin's death, Grice indeed led the playgroup until his 
departure  for the States. What's more important, while in the States he would 
gather at  his "at-homes" up the Berkeley Hills.
 
---- It's less clear what sort of convivial meeetings Carnap held while at  
Santa Monica, etc.

(my impression is that he was more isolated [RBJ])

\paragraph{Tarski}

"Tarski was invited to Vienna in February 1930 and lectured on  
metamathematics, which introduced Carnap to the use of formal metalanguages.  
Discussions with Tarski and with Gödel helped Carnap towards his theory of  logical 
syntax. He disagreed with Tarski on the analytic/synthetic dichotomy,  which 
Tarski thought a matter of degree. Carnap visited Warsaw in November 1930,  
giving lectures to the Warsaw Philosophical Society, talking privately to  
Tarski" you wrote.
  
Tarski. The influence of Tarski on Grice is much more roundoubt. Again, the 
 trigger was his rebel student, Strawson. In a famous talk at Bristol,  
much much later revisited by Warnock ("Bristol Revisited", in refs.) Strawson  
opposed Austin's correspondence theory of truth. Strawson argued that 'is  
true' was illocutionary in nature. This puzzles historians of philosophy as 
it  would have been natural to to think AUSTIN would have embraced such a 
view.  Yet, Austin, like Grice, were traditionalists in these. Grice dedicates 
a  whole section of his third William James lecture to a discussion of 
Tarski.  Grice ends up endorsing a neo-Tarskian view. The sentence of Tarski 
becomes an  utterance in Grice, but the basic Tarskian idea of 
'satisfactoriness' is  retained by Grice --. He even goes on to propose some implicatural 
solutions to  formal problems having to do with blind uses of the metalogical 
predicate  'true' in NL: "What the policeman said was true". Much later, when 
 generalising what he now called "alethic satisfactoriness", he introduces  
special apparatus to his System G to deal with satisfactoriness in realms 
other  than the alethic, notably the practical. 
 
\paragraph{Kant}
 
Kant. While it was Kant's 'theoretical' reason that only influenced Carnap, 
 Kant's influence on Grice was just as strong on the theoretical if not MO
RE in  the practical realm. Grice, unlike Carnap, looked for the UNITY of 
reason  and justification in all our attitudes: not just doxastic, but notably  
boulomaic. THis is a strong contrast with Carnap. His neo-Kantianism was  
theoretical in nature: aimed at epistemological problems concerning 
space/time  coordinates as Carnap found had to be 'vamped out' to deal with 
discoveries  by Einstein, etc. -- But Carnap remained an irrationalist in matters of  
value and ethics. Grice on the other hand possibly had with Kant the  
insight of the categorial imperative: the dark starry night sky above us.
 
etc. 

\paragraph{Wittgenstein}

you write of Carnap being 'excluded' as from 1929, but it's not clear what  
you mean.

(from the meetings with Wittgenstein)
 
In any case for Note
 
Wittgenstein, or Witters as the more irreverent Grice would have it.
Again, Carnap's contact was literally first hand.
Grice was a closet Wittgensteinian.
One reads his "Method in philosohical psychology" and finds whole 
passages verbatim from Witters without a recogntion (well, once).
Grice would often quote from Witters.
He is listed as an A-philosopher against which Grice reacts in the William James lectures.
 
---
 
First Wittgenstein, Last Wittgenstein, Middle Wittgenstein. The refinements 
 of Witters' philosophy are important for our reconstruction of the 
Griceland of  Carnapcopia. --- The first Wittgenstein falls squrely in the FL 
project of  Modernism. The middle Wittgenstein is the critical ie. crisis -- 
Witters. The  later Wittgenstein possibly had  a stronger influence on Grice 
than on  Carnap.
etc.

\paragraph{Quine. overlap}
 
Morris. The connection here is pretty interseting. While every schoolboy  
knows that Quine was THE logical positivist in the USA, Morris also visited 
both  Vienna and Prague.
 
The connection with Grice here is more indirect. But typically Gricean  
rather than triggered, as poor Grice often was, by Strawsonians whims. Grice 
had  read Stevenson's Ethics and language (1944), which was an offshot of 
Morris's  teaching. In 1948, Grice lectured publicly for the Oxford 
Philosophical Society  on "Meaning": he is opposing some simplified accounts of things 
he found in  STevenson -- but which he in private lectures at Oxford --  had 
extended to  cover Morris, and still earlier, Peirce.
 
---- The project of the unified science which was so Morrisian and  
Carnapian is less easy to detect in Grice. HIs treatment of the ethical views of  
Stevenson, however, shows his sympathy with a philosophy that is at least 
ready  and willing to be able to discourse on both matters alethic and practic.
 
etc.

1935 Philosophy and Logical Syntax - the text of  three lectures given in 
London in 1934  

--- where. etc.
 
---
This Grice must have been aware of. He was in his early 20s, then, but I  
would think Ayer would have made the thing known in Oxford. Grice was VERY  
concerned with what Austin was doing -- before the Phoney war.

1929 Abriss der Logistik - An Introduction to Logic giving special  
attention to the theory of relations and its applications.
 
 
--- Grice expands on the pirots that karulise elatically.
 
This can potch and cotch
 
and fed.
 
Fed is a variable for a relation ship. in Carnap's sense.
 
Grice made this public in the Lectures on Language and REality in a  
memorable summer symposium in Irvine in 1971. etc.

Good for Logic
Carnap observes that the state of Logic teaching in  the USA was much 
better than in Europe, 
 
--- this is echoed by Grice.
 
He confesses publicly that part of his professional reason -- one wonders:  
couldn't he just write? -- for moving to the States was "closer contact 
with  logicians".
 
Grice is already in 1969 quoting from BOolos, Parsons, Myro, Mates, etc.  
This is the beginning of his System G. Putnam would actually represss Grice's 
 formalistic fancies short: "You are too formal" he'd complain. Grice did 
not fit  the brit steroretype of the good humanistic Oxford don of the 
Austinian ilk. Of  course they were wrong. Grice fit NO stereotype. Etc.

how many angels could dance on the point of a needle." 
 
----
 
Grice cites the same example. In "Prejudices and Predilections".
 
To consider:
 
-- Note
 
-- Longitudinal unity/latitudinal unity. Metaphysics is important for Grice 
 as a manifestation of philosophy's latitudinal unity: everything connects 
and  metaphysics is the ground-floor discipline: the theory-theory or first  
philosophy. But unlike Carnap, Grice was an inveterate historicisit. He 
rejoiced  in what he called the longitudinal unity of philosophy which Carnap 
repudiated.  Grice found inspiration in time-honoured philosophies of 
Socrates, Plato,  Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, (Grice to the) Mill, etc. 
These he called  'the great'. He was less tolerant with the minors -- among 
which he  provocatively lists Witters!
 
--- etc. 

wiki ref. by you mentions Hempel
 
Grice cites Hempel and Reichenbach re: atomistic metaphysics in his  
"actions and events" PPQ, 1986. To provide quotes by me.
 
etc

1939 Russell @ Chicago lecturing on meaning and  truth  

----
 
Russell. Grice's attitude towards Russell is ambivalent. The most  
provocative Grice could get was in his "Definite descriptions in Russell and the  
vernacular", -- 1970. Grice was ambivalent because Russell himself was. He had 
 attacked Grice's student publicly ("Mr. Strawson on referring", 19--??. 
Mind.  While Grice disagreed with Strawson over details, he was of course 
going to  align with Strawson against Russell who was giving the Oxford school 
of ordinary  language philosophy some good press that actually worked very 
well for Grice's  professional life. So he had to be careful. His sympathies 
were for a  formalistic approach to langugages alla Russell and as evidenced 
in his System  G. But his 'pro-attitude' was institutional and he felt he 
NEEDED to  self-present as an ordinary-language philosopher, even if with very 
big  caveats.
 
1940-41 takes visiting professorship at Harvard  where Russell was giving 
the William James lectures.  

It is surprising Grice lists Phenomenalism as a bete noire. Carnap's  
tolerance for phenomenalism was well known. His first hand encounters with  
Goodman couldn't have been but positive. Grice's brand of phenomenalism was of  
an earlier vintage. None of the sophistification of Goodman. Grice's ideas of 
 phenomenalism were either the rather rough notes by Ayer and I. Berlin in 
a  rather influential paper in Mind in the 1930s. In the postwar period, 
Grice  would rely on work by G. A. Paul, "Is there a problem about sense data?" 
and  Austin's refutation of Ayer. Etc.

Grice and Carnap on physics. Carnap on Einstein. Grice on Eddington's two  
tables.
 
also:
 
inductivism. Strange Grice does not list this as bete noire. And  
confirmationism (Carnap's reply to Popper's falsificationism). The most  technical 
Grice gets on this is his scattered refs. to Kneale (Ind. and Prob) in  Reply 
to Richards, and his treatment of Davidsonian's probability operators in  
various publications vis a vis generalisations to desirability operators: 
 
Grice, Probability, Desirability and Mood Operators, 1973.

this above vis a vis your ref. to Carnap/Kemeny
 
 
Bar-Hillel is cited by Chapman in connection with a possible influence of  
Carnap on Grice. Bar-Hillel had worked with Carnap and comes out with this 
idea  that the divergence between FL and NL is in the 'implicature'. He uses  
'implication' and it's the idea of pragmatics as the wastebasket of  
philosophers. Grice on metaphysical excrescences. etc. 
 
 
 To  add to

Phenomenalism.  It is surprising Grice lists Phenomenalism as a bete 
noire. Carnap's tolerance  for phenomenalism was well known. His first hand

Biographical.  Griceland. Herbert Paul Grice was born in Harborne, Staffs 
in 1913 and died in  1988. He wrote this far three books: Way of Words, 
Conception of Value, Aspects  of Reason. Educated at Clifton and Corpus Christi, 
he was Tutor in Philosophy for more than forty years at St. John's to end 
as full prof. of philo at Berkeley.




---  The connection between Grice and 
Frege is only recently being developed, mainly  due to efforts by Beaney and 
L. Horn. Much of the subtler writings by Frege on  'tone', 'colour' and 
'force' can be given proper Gricean  interpretations. 
A  Generation Gap. Carnap fought in the Great War. Grice in the 'phoney' 
one.  Grice's father was operative during the Great War when Carnap fought. 
Grice's  father was a businessman -- a rather poor one. He invented a 
contraception that  was good during the Great War but found useless in the

Generation  Gap and All. The Overlap. Carnap gave three renowned lectures 
in London in 1934. This  Grice must have been aware of. He was in his early 
20s, then, but I’d think Ayer  would have made the thing known in Oxford. 
Grice was VERY  concerned with  what Austin was doing -- before the Phoney war.

The  Oxford Circle. The Berkeley Circle. If Carnap was ultimately Vienna 
Circle,  there’s more of a larger geographical spectrum in Grice. "The Carnap 
Circle" --  by this we mean the Carnap convivial approach to philosophy. 
This is echoed in  the Grice Circle. Grice could only work philosophically in 
convivial conditions.  Although he never belonged to the early Austin club, 
he was a regular, indeed,  Austin's favourite member of Austin's playgroup.

Russell has to be  the lingua franca Carnap/Grice. Russell's influence on Carnap, 
which was  actually two-way, was invaluable. Carnap was the Russelian par 
excellence. The  influence of Russell on Grice is much more roundabout. Grice 
got an interest in  Russell's modernism, as he calls it, after Strawson had 
challenged it in Intro  to logical theory (1952), which was as influential 
in Oxford as Carnap's Intro  to Semantics had been in the USA. Take the FL   
vs   NL.  Grice is clear in the ideology behind this. There's what he calls 
Modernism and  Neo-Modernism. This is Russell and the heirs of PM. This 
INCLUDES, almost by  antonomasia, CARNAP. But then there's neo-Traditionalism, 
and earlier,  Traditionalism. By this Grice means Aristotelian logic (made 
respectable by  Lukasiewicz) and Strawson's and indeed Oxonian 
ordinary-language philosophical  logic. 
--  the idea that '\&', 'v', --$>$ -- the connectives in the syntax of FL -- 
do  not correspond to the vernaculars of NL 'and', 'or', 'if'. Vide Carnap on 
this  for a formalist (vs informalist) view. Grice came to prefer the  
modernism-traditionalism distinction to his earlier formalim-informalism. The  
important thing here is not so much the labels for these sorts of betes 
noires,  but Grice's own brand: the way he saw or presented himself "in society" 
-- and  what he called the longitudinal history of philosophy: "a foot in 
each camp", he  jokes. But in essence, that's the aptest description of his 
position. For his  System G-- complete with a pragmatics, allows to maintain 
that the alleged  divergences between NL and FL are a matter of 
'implicature' rather than logical  form.  At the end of the Gricean  day, Grice's  
attitude towards Russell is ambivalent. The most  provocative Grice could  get 
was in his "Definite descriptions in Russell and the  
vernacular",  -- 1970. Grice was ambivalent because Russell himself was. He 
had attacked  Grice's student publicly ("Mr. Strawson on referring", Mind.  
While Grice  disagreed with Strawson over details, he was of course going 
to  align with  Strawson against Russell who was giving the Oxford school of 
ordinary   language philosophy some good press that actually worked very 
well for  Grice's  professional life. So he had to be careful. His sympathies 
were  for a  formalistic approach to languages alla Russell and as evidenced 
in  his System  G. But his 'pro-attitude' was institutional and he felt he  
NEEDED to  self-present as an ordinary-language philosopher, even if with  
very big  caveats. 
Grice  and the Morris connection. The connection here is pretty 
interseting. While  every schoolboy knows that Quine was THE logical positivist in the 
USA, Morris  also visited both Vienna and Prague. The connection with Grice 
here is more  indirect. But typically Gricean rather than triggered, as poor 
Grice often was,  by Strawsonians whims. Grice had read Stevenson's Ethics 
and language (1944),  which was an offshot of Morris's teaching. In 1948, 
Grice lectured publicly for  the Oxford Philosophical Society on "Meaning": he 
is opposing some simplified  accounts of things he found in STevenson -- 
but which he in private lectures at  Oxford --  had extended to cover Morris, 
and still earlier, Peirce. The  project of the unified science which was so 
Morrisian and Carnapian is less easy  to detect in Grice. HIs treatment of 
the ethical views of Stevenson, however,  shows his sympathy with a 
philosophy that is at least ready and willing to be  able to discourse on both 
matters alethic and practic. 
Grice  on Tarski. Lingua Franca gets an accent, or Tarski disquoted. The 
influence of  Tarski on Grice is much more roundoubt. Again, the trigger was 
his rebel  student, Strawson. In a famous talk at Bristol, much much later 
revisited  by Warnock ("Bristol Revisited", in refs.) Strawson opposed 
Austin's  correspondence theory of truth. Strawson argued that 'is true' was  
illocutionary in nature. This puzzles historians of philosophy as it would have  
been natural to to think AUSTIN would have embraced such a view. Yet,  
Austin, like Grice, were traditionalists in these. Grice dedicates a whole  
section of his third William James lecture to a discussion of Tarski. Grice ends  
up endorsing a neo-Tarskian view. The sentence of Tarski becomes an 
utterance in  Grice, but the basic Tarskian idea of 'satisfactoriness' is retained 
by Grice  --. He even goes on to propose some implicatural solutions to 
formal problems  having to do with blind uses of the metalogical predicate 
'true' in NL:  "What the policeman said was true". Much later, when generalising 
what he  now called "alethic satisfactoriness", he introduces special 
apparatus to his  System G to deal with satisfactoriness in realms other than the 
alethic,  notably the practical.  
Grice  on Wittgenstein. “Not my man”. Wittgenstein, or Witters as the more 
irreverent  Grice would have it. Again, Carnap's contact was literally 
first hand. Grice  was a closet Wittgensteinian. One reads his "Method in 
philosohical  psychology" and finds whoe passages verbatim from Witters without a 
recogntion  (well, once). Grice would often quote from Witters. He is listed 
as an  A-philosopher against which Grice reacts in the William James 
lectures. First  Wittgenstein, Last Wittgenstein, Middle Wittgenstein. The 
refinements of  Witters' philosophy are important for our reconstruction of the 
Griceland of  Carnapcopia. --- The first Wittgenstein falls squrely in the FL 
project of  Modernism. The middle Wittgenstein is the critical ie. crisis -- 
Witters. The  later Wittgenstein possibly had  a stronger influence on Grice 
than on  Carnap. 
Grice  on Hempel and Reichenbach. Grice cites Hempel and Reichenbach re: 
atomistic  metaphysics in his "actions and events" PPQ, 1986.  
Grice  on Quine, Grice on Chomsky. While  Carnap would write, "The men who 
had the strongest  influence on my  philosophical thinking were Frege and 
Russell" in that order,  Grice could  be more irreverent. A 1913-born man 
finds the strongest influence in  a  linguist born in the 1930s: Noam Chomsky 
and the Vienna Circle refugee:  Quine.  --"I have to admit" Grice writes (or 
words), that what "I admired  in them is  their method -- never their ideas, 
which I never respected,  really". Grice's choice is particularly agonistic: 
in the sense that it provokes  sheer agony in  us: "for I never ... over 
the fact that these two genii  never agreed ON  ANYTHING". And they lived so 
close!

Secularism.  Grice's religious inclinations are harder to pin down than 
Carnap’s. Chapman in  fact sounds rather authoritative when she states that 
"Grice lost all faith by  the age of 19" or something. You can never be so 
sure. Chapman redeems herself  by noting the very many religious references, 
eschatological and Biblical, in  Grice's various writings. While a disbeliever 
in God, Grice liked to play God.  Borrowing on this idea by Carnap of 
pirots which karulize elatically, Grice  founds a full programme in the vein of 
the ideal-observer. What we would do, as  God, to secure the survival of 
pirots. While not religious in nature, it has a  religious tone that is absent 
in the writings of Carnap in any  respect. 
Scholasticism  rears its pretty face. how many angels could dance on the 
point of a needle.  Grice cites the same example. In "Prejudices and 
Predilections". To consider:  Longitudinal unity/latitudinal unity. Metaphysics is 
important for Grice as a  manifestation of philosophy's latitudinal unity: 
everything connects and  metaphysics is the ground-floor discipline: the 
theory-theory or first  philosophy. But unlike Carnap, Grice was an inveterate 
historicisit. He rejoiced  in what he called the longitudinal unity of 
philosophy which Carnap repudiated.  Grice found inspiration in time-honoured 
philosophies of Socrates, Plato,  Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, (Grice to 
the) Mill, etc. These he called  'the great'. He was less tolerant with the 
minors -- among which he  provocatively lists Witters! 
 

More  on the pirot talk. Vis a vis Carnap’s focus on relations in his 1929  
Abriss der Logistik, Grice expands on the pirots that karulise elatically. 
These  can potch and cotch and fed – where Fed is a variable for a relation 
ship. in  Carnap's sense. Grice made this public in the Lectures on Language 
and Reality  in a  memorable summer symposium in Irvine in 1971. etc. 
Can  pirots implicate? Bar-Hillel  is cited by Chapman in connection with a 
possible influence of Carnap on Grice.  Bar-Hillel had worked with Carnap 
and comes out with this idea that the  divergence between FL and NL is in the 
'implicature'. He uses 'implication' and  it's the idea of pragmatics as 
the wastebasket of philosophers. Grice on  metaphysical excrescences. etc.

To  be pasted at end of ch. ii (c) J. L. S. -- are we doing this so that 
ch. ii only  is (c) J. L. S. Perhaps you think that appropriate. 
In  any case when you do paste it to the pdf let know so I can read it from 
the pdf.  So on another sitting I go through the whole ch. ii and provide 
some editorial  thingy. etc. Nothing to worry about. I'll be brief with the 
editorial  thingy. 
And  note that YOU are free to edit anything I write from your perspective 
and that  you DO NOT have to let me know what editorial changes you make. I 
trust you  editorially and philosophically. I do not need to have (c) J.L.S. 
only. We can  make a short mention about this in the foreword, "The ch. ii 
is obviously more  of the work of J.L.S. for whom he is thus mainly 
responsible. The rest is mainly  RBJ." Or something. 
etc. 
Phenomenalism.  It is surprising Grice lists Phenomenalism as a bete 
noire. Carnap's tolerance  for phenomenalism was well known. His first hand 
encounters with Goodman  couldn't have been but positive. Grice's brand of 
phenomenalism was of an  earlier vintage. None of the sophistification of 
Goodman. Grice's ideas of  phenomenalism were either the rather rough notes by Ayer 
and I. Berlin in a  rather influential paper in Mind in the 1930s. In the 
postwar period, Grice  would rely on work by G. A. Paul, "Is there a problem 
about sense data?" and  Austin's refutation of Ayer. Etc. 
Inductivism.  Grice and Carnap on physics. Carnap on Einstein. Grice on 
Eddington's two  tables. Also: 
inductivism.  Strange Grice does not list this as bete noire. And 
confirmationism (Carnap's  reply to Popper's falsificationism). The most technical 
Grice gets on this is  his scattered refs. to Kneale (Ind. and Prob) in Reply 
to Richards, and his  treatment of Davidsonian's probability operators in 
various publications vis a  vis generalisations to desirability operators:  
Grice, Probability, Desirability and Mood  Operators, 1973. Grice Aspects of 
Reason. On Probably, as a sentence modifier.   
Biographical.  Griceland. Herbert Paul Grice was born in Harborne, Staffs 
in 1913 and died in  1988. He wrote this far three books: Way of Words, 
Conception of Value, Aspects  of Reason. Educated at Clifton and Corpus Christi, 
he was Tutor in Philosophy  for more than forty years at St. John's to end 
as full prof. of philo at  Berkeley. ---  The connection between Grice and 
Frege is only recently being developed, mainly  due to efforts by Beaney and 
L. Horn. Much of the subtler writings by Frege on  'tone', 'colour' and 
'force' can be given proper Gricean  interpretations. 
A  Generation Gap. Carnap fought in the Great War. Grice in the 'phoney' 
one.  Grice's father was operative during the Great War when Carnap fought. 
Grice's  father was a businessman -- a rather poor one. He invented a 
contraception that  was good during the Great War but found useless in the 
aftermath. In 1939 Grice  joined the RN and fought the Germans in mid-Atlantic 
theatre of operation. He  was transferred to Admiralty in London in 1942. Carnap 
possibly acquired some  pessimism after the Great War. After all, the Germans 
lost. This contrasts  with the strange optimism felt by the Brits in the 
post-war period. Grice  included. They were grown up, they had been forced to 
grow up too soon. Yet they  had not been able to develop their philosophical 
talents. Now in their thirties,  a whole generation had been devastated. 
They had no time to lose. Grice's  efforts were directed at the formation of a 
new generation of philosophers at  Oxford -- along with his current fare of 
unappointed tuttees. Strawson was  Grice's favourite student, and the one 
which gave some sense to his rambling  life. At the senior level, the 
influence of Austin was  paramount. 
Generation  Gap and All. The Overlap. Carnap gave three renowned lectures 
in London in 1934. This  Grice must have been aware of. He was in his early 
20s, then, but I’d think Ayer  would have made the thing known in Oxford. 
Grice was VERY  concerned with  what Austin was doing -- before the Phoney war.

The  Oxford Circle. The Berkeley Circle. If Carnap was ultimately Vienna 
Circle,  there’s more of a larger geographical spectrum in Grice. "The Carnap 
Circle" --  by this we mean the Carnap convivial approach to philosophy. 
This is echoed in  the Grice Circle. Grice could only work philosophically in 
convivial conditions.  Although he never belonged to the early Austin club, 
he was a regular, indeed,  Austin's favourite member of Austin's playgroup. 
On Austin's death, Grice indeed  led the playgroup until his departure for 
the States. What's more important,  while in the States he would gather at his 
"at-homes" up the Berkeley Hills.  It's less clear what sort of convivial 
meeetings Carnap held while at Santa  Monica, etc. 
>From  Oxford to the New World – but back. Carnap  observes that the state 
of Logic teaching in  the USA was much better than  in Europe. This is echoed 
by Grice. He confesses publicly that part of his  professional reason -- 
one wonders:  couldn't he just write? -- for moving  to the States was "closer 
contact 
with  logicians". Grice is already in  1969 quoting from Boolos, Parsons, 
Myro, Mates, etc.  This is the beginning  of his System G. Putnam would 
actually represss Grice's formalistic fancies  short: "You are too formal" he'd 
complain. Grice did not fit  the brit  steroretype of the good humanistic 
Oxford don of the 
Austinian ilk. Of   course they were wrong. Grice fit NO stereotype. Etc.

Diagogism. The  diagogic. Further to the gladiatorial and the 
conversational, it is  worth  pointing out that the later Grice grew less and less 
tolerant of 'epagoge'   and more and more embracing of diagoge. The distinction is 
Aristotelian,  but  Grice's twist reminds one of Carnap's pro-attitude for 
dialogue  as   stimulating. Grice's  father had been a musician and so was 
his younger brother Derek.  The trios  they engaged in in Harborne gave Grice 
a rich ... (thing) about the value of  cooperation: "Getting together to do 
philosophy should be like getting  to  play music". The epagoge/diagoge 
distinction is a basic one for Grice's  metaphysical  methodology. If evidence 
is, as the neo-Kantian he was, all  too clearly  
necessary, one would hope however that the BASIS for this  or that 
metaphysical  claim (or rejection) should rest on its own virtues  rather than on 
the success  or failure of having confronted its  antithesis. 
Grice  on Kant. The  double influence.The influence of Kant on Grice was a 
later one. As an Oxonian,  Kant was not really taken too seriously. In this 
respect, Carnap's education was  more traditionally philosophical (His PhD 
which Grice never attained, was  published in Kant Studien). Grice first came 
to the proximities of Kant via  Abbott's translation, and thus he was more 
of a minor Kantian than Carnap was,  who could savour Kant in the 
vernacular! -- In 1966, Sir Peter Strawson, Grice's  former student, published his 
"Bounds of Sense" which brought Kant to the  Oxonian map. Grice will later be 
invited to deliver the Kant Lectures at  Stanford. But  importantly for the 
present conversation: while it was Kant's 'theoretical'  reason that only 
influenced Carnap, Kant's influence on Grice was just as strong  on the 
theoretical if not MORE in the practical realm. Grice, unlike  Carnap, looked for 
the UNITY of reason and justification in all  our attitudes: not just 
doxastic, but notably boulomaic. THis is a strong  contrast with Carnap. His 
neo-Kantianism was theoretical in nature: aimed at  epistemological problems 
concerning space/time coordinates as Carnap  found had to be 'vamped out' to deal 
with discoveries by Einstein, etc.  -- But Carnap remained an irrationalist 
in matters of value and  ethics. Grice on the other hand possibly had with 
Kant the insight of the  categorial imperative: the dark starry night sky 
above us. 
Grice  on Frege. Frege was of course one of the inspiring models for 
Carnap. For  Grice the Frege influence came much later. There is one single ref. 
to Frege by  Grice in his "Prejudices and Predilections" and this only in 
connection with the  idea of the Fregean 'sense' -- he writes, "in something 
like a Fregean sense".  Grice is considering, however, one of his 
'metaphysical' routines. His Humean  projection is supposed to deliver concepts alla 
Fregean senses. E.g. the concept  of negation, the concept of value, the 
concept of -- you name  it. 
Grice  on Russell. Russell as Lingua Franca between Carnap and Grice. 
Russell has to be  the lingua franca Carnap/Grice. Russell's influence on Carnap, 
which was  actually two-way, was invaluable. Carnap was the Russelian par 
excellence. The  influence of Russell on Grice is much more roundabout. Grice 
got an interest in  Russell's modernism, as he calls it, after Strawson had 
challenged it in Intro  to logical theory (1952), which was as influential 
in Oxford as Carnap's Intro  to Semantics had been in the USA. Take the FL   
vs   NL.  Grice is clear in the ideology behind this. There's what he calls 
Modernism and  Neo-Modernism. This is Russell and the heirs of PM. This 
INCLUDES, almost by  antonomasia, CARNAP. But then there's neo-Traditionalism, 
and earlier,  Traditionalism. By this Grice means Aristotelian logic (made 
respectable by  Lukasiewicz) and Strawson's and indeed Oxonian 
ordinary-language philosophical  logic. 
--  the idea that '\&', 'v', --$>$ -- the connectives in the syntax of FL -- 
do  not correspond to the vernaculars of NL 'and', 'or', 'if'. Vide Carnap on 
this  for a formalist (vs informalist) view. Grice came to prefer the  
modernism-traditionalism distinction to his earlier formalim-informalism. The  
important thing here is not so much the labels for these sorts of betes 
noires,  but Grice's own brand: the way he saw or presented himself "in society" 
-- and  what he called the longitudinal history of philosophy: "a foot in 
each camp", he  jokes. But in essence, that's the aptest description of his 
position. For his  System G-- complete with a pragmatics, allows to maintain 
that the alleged  divergences between NL and FL are a matter of 
'implicature' rather than logical  form.  At the end of the Gricean  day, Grice's  
attitude towards Russell is ambivalent. The most  provocative Grice could  get 
was in his "Definite descriptions in Russell and the  
vernacular",  -- 1970. Grice was ambivalent because Russell himself was. He 
had attacked  Grice's student publicly ("Mr. Strawson on referring", Mind.  
While Grice  disagreed with Strawson over details, he was of course going 
to  align with  Strawson against Russell who was giving the Oxford school of 
ordinary   language philosophy some good press that actually worked very 
well for  Grice's  professional life. So he had to be careful. His sympathies 
were  for a  formalistic approach to languages alla Russell and as evidenced 
in  his System  G. But his 'pro-attitude' was institutional and he felt he  
NEEDED to  self-present as an ordinary-language philosopher, even if with  
very big  caveats. 
Grice  and the Morris connection. The connection here is pretty 
interseting. While  every schoolboy knows that Quine was THE logical positivist in the 
USA, Morris  also visited both Vienna and Prague. The connection with Grice 
here is more  indirect. But typically Gricean rather than triggered, as poor 
Grice often was,  by Strawsonians whims. Grice had read Stevenson's Ethics 
and language (1944),  which was an offshot of Morris's teaching. In 1948, 
Grice lectured publicly for  the Oxford Philosophical Society on "Meaning": he

but which he in private lectures at  Oxford --  had extended to cover Morris, 
and still earlier, Peirce. The  project of the unified science which was so 
Morrisian and Carnapian is less easy  to detect in Grice. HIs treatment of 
the ethical views of Stevenson, however,  shows his sympathy with a 
philosophy that is at least ready and willing to be  able to discourse on both 
matters alethic and practic. 
Grice  on Tarski. Lingua Franca gets an accent, or Tarski disquoted. The 
influence of  Tarski on Grice is much more roundoubt. Again, the trigger was 
his rebel  student, Strawson. In a famous talk at Bristol, much much later

illocutionary in nature. This puzzles historians of philosophy as it would have  
been natural to to think AUSTIN would have embraced such a view. Yet,  
Austin, like Grice, were traditionalists in these. Grice dedicates a whole  
section of his third William James lecture to a discussion of Tarski. Grice ends  
up endorsing a neo-Tarskian view. The sentence of Tarski becomes an 
utterance in  Grice, but the basic Tarskian idea of 'satisfactoriness' is retained 
by Grice  --. He even goes on to propose some implicatural solutions to 
formal problems  having to do with blind uses of the metalogical predicate 
'true' in NL:  "What the policeman said was true". Much later, when generalising 
what he  now called "alethic satisfactoriness", he introduces special 
apparatus to his  System G to deal with satisfactoriness in realms other than the 
alethic,  notably the practical.  
Grice  on Wittgenstein. “Not my man”. Wittgenstein, or Witters as the more 
irreverent  Grice would have it. Again, Carnap's contact was literally 
first hand. Grice  was a closet Wittgensteinian. One reads his "Method in 
philosohical  psychology" and finds whoe passages verbatim from Witters without a

as an  A-philosopher against which Grice reacts in the William James

project of  Modernism. The middle Wittgenstein is the critical ie. crisis -- 
Witters. The  later Wittgenstein possibly had  a stronger influence on Grice 
than on  Carnap. 
Grice  on Hempel and Reichenbach. Grice cites Hempel and Reichenbach re: 
atomistic  metaphysics in his "actions and events" PPQ, 1986.  
Grice  on Quine, Grice on Chomsky. While  Carnap would write, "The men who 
had the strongest  influence on my  philosophical thinking were Frege and 
Russell" in that order,  Grice could  be more irreverent. A 1913-born man 
finds the strongest influence in  a  linguist born in the 1930s: Noam Chomsky 
and the Vienna Circle refugee:  Quine.  --"I have to admit" Grice writes (or 
words), that what "I admired  in them is  their method -- never their ideas, 
which I never respected,  really". Grice's choice is particularly agonistic: 
in the sense that it provokes  sheer agony in  us: "for I never ... over 
the fact that these two genii  never agreed ON  ANYTHING". And they lived so 
close!

Secularism.  Grice's religious inclinations are harder to pin down than 
Carnap’s. Chapman in  fact sounds rather authoritative when she states that 
"Grice lost all faith by  the age of 19" or something. You can never be so

More  on the pirot talk. Vis a vis Carnap’s focus on relations in his 1929

These  can potch and cotch and fed – where Fed is a variable for a relation 
ship. in  Carnap's sense. Grice made this public in the Lectures on Language 
and Reality  in a  memorable summer symposium in Irvine in 1971. etc. 
Can  pirots implicate?

Bar-Hillel  is cited by Chapman in connection with a 
possible influence of Carnap on Grice.  Bar-Hillel had worked with Carnap 
and comes out with this idea that the  divergence between FL and NL is in the 
'implicature'. He uses 'implication' and  it's the idea of pragmatics as 
the wastebasket of philosophers. Grice on  metaphysical excrescences. etc.

For the NOTES
 
 
--- Waismann. Grice, as a Brit, would be more familiar with the views of  
Waismann, the member of the Vienna Circle who had made it to England. 
 
--- Grice lectured on metaphysics for the BBC. The result is in D. F.  
Pears, The nature of metaphysics, 1957. This is vintage Grice. I.e. Grice  
self-presenting as a metaphysician as 'ambitious' as Kantotle was. Metaphysics  
was starting to cease being the term of abuse he felt Ayer had turned  onto.

 
 
---- Grice, unlike Carnap, was professionally involved in DEFENDING  
metaphysics. He delivered annually two courses on Metaphysics. Usually with G.  
Myro. Naturally, he felt the professional defence of the discipline was what 
was  professionally and institutionally required from him, especially after 
becoming  Full prof. at Berkeley in 1975. 
 
---- Grice's student, Sir Peter Strawson had become by 1968 the standard  
for metaphysical theory as understood in England and Oxford. As Waynflete  
professor he became more and more interested in neo-Kantian foundations for 
the  discipline.
 
---- Myro was a special influence in Grice's metaphysical thought.  
Originated educated at Oxford in Balliol, he had a strict logical background and  
inspired Grice in much of what transpired as Grice's System Q, which Myro 
later  re-baptised System G -- "in gratitude to Paul Grice for the original 
idea"
 
---- The syntax of System G makes use of scope devices to allow for  
pragmatic implicature. These undertake two forms:
(i) the use of square brackets to indicate common-ground status. Grice  
provides formal rules for the introduction and elimination of square brackets 
in  WoW:xviii)
(ii) the use of numerical subscripts (in Vacuous Names). This allows for  
the scope maximal readings of formulae but allowing as well for a minimal  
reading upon a simple numerical transformation. 
 
----
 
Grice and Strawson had defended the analytic-syntetic distinction in "In  
defense of a dogma" but Grice grew sceptical as to the success of that 
defense  (of an underdogma, as he later had it). He grew more and more pragmatist 
towards  the viability of the need to postulate the distinction.
 
---
 
Carnap's "meaning postulates" have affinities with Grice's notion of  
'entailment' which he drew from Moore. Moore, while not a formal logician, is  
responsible for this coinage, which appealed Grice, as he would contrast, in 
his  System G, only entailment with 'implicature'. There would be no place 
for  'presupposition' or truth-value gaps in this scheme, as there is in 
Strawson.  The metaphysical implications of Grice's choice of a bivalent standard 
 interpretation of System G are obvious.
 
Grice spoke excellent English. As Clifton and Corpus Christi educated, he  
found easily crowds of followers, especially in America, in younger 
philosophers  who had grown tired of their dogmatic empiricist teachers. Grice 
brought a  breath of fresh air. This is ironical as seen from the other side of 
the 'pond',  in that the breath of fresh air can be looked, in a sort of 
inverted snobbery,  as an irreverent reactionary dogmatism!  On the other hand, 
Carnap was  perhaps less influential among the younger philosophers. 
 
It's pretty easy to trace genealogical trees from Grice to the major  
figures in the Anglo-American analytic philosophy of a decade ago or so. It is  
perhaps less easy to do same with Carnap.
 
Important metaphysicians with Gricean influences include G. Bealer, G. Myro 
 in the USA. Strawson and Peacocke in the US.
 
---- A search for 'metaphysics' and Grice retrieves ..... hits in Google.  
It retrieves ... for 'metaphysics' and Carnap.
 
 
 
---- The growth, continuing, of Gricean bibliography is overwhelming. Books 
 published in his memory, although not necessarily from cutting-edge  
philosophers. He was after all, a philosopher's philosopher. The secondary  
bibliography on Carnap is perhaps not so vast.


To  add to 
“Whatever”;  Being  
A  Conversation Between Carnap And Grice” 
---  at the end of chapter II, Grice.  
Phenomenalism.  It is surprising Grice lists Phenomenalism as a bete 
noire. Carnap's tolerance  for phenomenalism was well known. His first hand 
encounters with Goodman  couldn't have been but positive. Grice's brand of 
phenomenalism was of an  earlier vintage. None of the sophistification of 
Goodman. Grice's ideas of  phenomenalism were either the rather rough notes by Ayer 
and I. Berlin in a  rather influential paper in Mind in the 1930s. In the 
postwar period, Grice  would rely on work by G. A. Paul, "Is there a problem 
about sense data?" and  Austin's refutation of Ayer. Etc. 
Inductivism.  Grice and Carnap on physics. Carnap on Einstein. Grice on 
Eddington's two  tables. Also: 
inductivism.  Strange Grice does not list this as bete noire. And 
confirmationism (Carnap's  reply to Popper's falsificationism). The most technical 
Grice gets on this is  his scattered refs. to Kneale (Ind. and Prob) in Reply 
to Richards, and his  treatment of Davidsonian's probability operators in 
various publications vis a  vis generalisations to desirability operators:  
Grice, Probability, Desirability and Mood  Operators, 1973. Grice Aspects of 
Reason. On Probably, as a sentence modifier.   
Biographical.  Griceland. Herbert Paul Grice was born in Harborne, Staffs 
in 1913 and died in  1988. He wrote this far three books: Way of Words, 
Conception of Value, Aspects  of Reason. Educated at Clifton and Corpus Christi, 
he was Tutor in Philosophy  for more than forty years at St. John's to end 
as full prof. of philo at  Berkeley. ---  The connection between Grice and 
Frege is only recently being developed, mainly  due to efforts by Beaney and 
L. Horn. Much of the subtler writings by Frege on  'tone', 'colour' and 
'force' can be given proper Gricean  interpretations. 
>From  Aristotle to the 21st century and back.  It really all starts with 
Aristotle. Hume  is Where the Heart Is, but Kant is the big influence when we 
are speaking of the  Carnap/Grice interface. Grice refers to “Kantotle” and 
“Ariskant” as apt  abbreviations of what he has in mind when he thinks of 
the greatest of them all.  If the early Carnap is best seen as a 
neo-Kantian, Grice’s pedigree can be  traced back as early as Oxford Hegelianism. Ryle, 
who had been an adherent of  Heidegger (and had reviewed Heiddegger’s Sein 
und Zeit for Mind in 1929, had  sent Ayer to Vienna (Ayer’s Weiner Kreis 
crisis, as it were). On his return, the  ‘enfant-terrible’ as he then was and 
Grice depicts him as, he soon splits from  Austin's playgroup. Everything 
Grice notes, was brought to a halt with The  Phoney War. After the war, Grice 
becomes more and more influential in Austin's  'kindergarten', and 
eventually gets the greatest credit of them all: he travels  to the USA to deliver 
the William James, where he manages to pun on Heidegger  alla 
Carnap  ("Heidegger is the greatest living philosopher, if you can take me 
seriously"  (WoW:i)). It’s sadly after Carnap’s demise that Grice 
introduces his  “pirotological programme” in the APA presidential address (Pacific 
Division) for  1975. He becomes more metaphysical as gives the Carus Lectures 
(published as  Grice 1991). His postmortem influence grows as his Aspects 
of Reason lectures  get published  in  2001. 
Grice  regards metaphysics as comprising both a general and a special 
branch. The  general branch comprises two subbranches, metaphysics proper, qua 
theory of the  category, and eschatology, qua theory of transcategorial 
epithets. The special  branch includes cosmology and rational psychology.  
System  G-HP. Grice lists 13 items (WoW:ii) which Grice thinks are 
constitutive of a  good formal language. They reproduce almost verbatim Carnap’s own 
ideas of  axiomatic languages which he had drawn independently from Euclid 
and the modern  formal logicians like Frege and Goedel. System G-hp is best 
illustrated with  simple utterances like the one Carnap used in “
Introduction to Semantics”. Grice  agrees that lack of sense here is actually a good 
thing. For what is the logical  form of, "Pirots karulize elatically”? We need 
a meaning postulate. An x is a  pirot P iff it karulize K,  where K is 
extensionally defined as a class such that its members are the  denotata of all 
the names of pirots. The ‘elatically’ qua adverb should not  deviate us 
from the gist of the logical form. More important is the need to  quantify. Are 
all pirots meant? Or is there some scalar implicature at work  (“Some 
pirots karulise elatically”; 
“some not”. Is karulising the pirot’s  raison d’etre. Is, in the words of 
Carnap’s meaning-and-necessity something that  holds for all possible 
worlds where pirots exist? In other words, indeed  Aristotle’s, is karulising an 
essential property for pirots? Are we to read  Carnpas sentence as pirots 
having (“MUST” to karulis elatically? These are the  goals. The means are 
simple enough in Morrisian terms. We need first a   
Syntactics  – where 'proof' is defined, with Gentzen-type rules added for 
good measure (if  we are going to formalize this as (x)Px à  Kx, we need 
introduction and elimination rules for both (x) and à.  Then we need a proper 
formal Semantics. This should allow for scope indicator  devices. While 
pragmatics in Carnapcopia is the realm of pragmatism, the  landscape of Griceland 
is more formal. The third element in System G,  Pragmatics, is the realm of 
implicature 
The  lives and opinions of Carnap and Grice. Grice, as a Brit, would be 
more familiar  with the views of Waismann, the member of the Vienna Circle who 
had made it to  England. Grice lectured on metaphysics for the BBC. The 
result is in D. F.  Pears, The nature of metaphysics, 1957. This is vintage 
Grice. I.e. Grice  self-presenting as a metaphysician as 'ambitious' as Kantotle 
was. Metaphysics  was starting to cease being the term of abuse he felt 
Ayer had turned  onto. 
Metaphysics  as a discipline in need of professional defence. Grice, unlike 
Carnap, was  professionally involved in DEFENDING metaphysics. He delivered 
annually two  courses on Metaphysics. Usually with G. Myro. Naturally, he 
felt the  professional defence of the discipline was what was professionally 
and  institutionally required from him, especially after becoming Full prof. 
at  Berkeley in 1975. Grice's student, Sir Peter Strawson had become by 
1968 the  standard for metaphysical theory as understood in England and 
Oxford. As  Waynflete professor he became more and more interested in neo-Kantian 
 foundations for the discipline. 
How  formal can we get. Myro was a special influence in Grice's 
metaphysical thought.  Originated educated at Oxford in Balliol, he had a strict 
logical background and  inspired Grice in much of what transpired as Grice's 
System Q, which Myro later  re-baptised System G -- "in gratitude to Paul Grice 
for the original idea". The  syntax of System G makes use of scope devices to 
allow for pragmatic  implicature. These undertake two forms: (i) the use of 
square brackets to  indicate common-ground status. Grice provides formal 
rules for the introduction  and elimination of square brackets in WoW:xviii) 
(ii)  the use of numerical subscripts (in Vacuous Names). This allows for 
the scope  maximal readings of formulae but allowing as well for a minimal 
reading upon a  simple numerical transformation.  
Dogmatism.  Grice and Strawson had defended the analytic-synthetic 
distinction in "In  defense of a dogma" but Grice grew sceptical as to the success 
of that defense  (of an underdogma, as he later had it). He grew more and 
more pragmatist towards  the viability of the need to postulate the 
distinction. 
Semantics  for System G. Carnap's "meaning postulates" have affinities with 
Grice's notion  of 'entailment' which he drew from Moore. Moore, while not 
a formal logician, is  responsible for this coinage, which appealed Grice,

There would be no place for  'presupposition' or truth-value gaps in this 
scheme, as there is in Strawson.  The metaphysical implications of Grice's 
choice of a bivalent standard  interpretation of System G are obvious. 
The  Man is the Style. Grice spoke excellent English. As Clifton and Corpus 
Christi  educated, he found easily crowds of followers, especially in 
America, in younger  philosophers who had grown tired of their dogmatic 
empiricist teachers. Grice  brought a breath of fresh air. This is ironical as seen 
from the other side of  the 'pond', in that the breath of fresh air can be 
looked, in a sort of inverted  snobbery, as an irreverent reactionary 
dogmatism!  On the other hand,  Carnap was perhaps less influential among the 
younger philosophers.   
Griceland  and Carnapcopia Galore. It's pretty easy to trace genealogical 
trees from Grice  to the major figures in the Anglo-American analytic 
philosophy of a decade ago  or so. It is perhaps less easy to do same with Carnap. 
Important metaphysicians  with Gricean influences include G. Bealer, G. Myro

Books published in his memory, although  not necessarily from cutting-edge 
philosophers. He was after all, a  philosopher's philosopher. The secondary 
bibliography on Carnap is perhaps not  so vast. 
A  Generation Gap. Carnap fought in the Great War. Grice in the 'phoney' 
one.  Grice's father was operative during the Great War when Carnap fought. 
Grice's  father was a businessman -- a rather poor one. He invented a 
contraception that  was good during the Great War but found useless in the 
aftermath. In 1939 Grice  joined the RN and fought the Germans in mid-Atlantic 
theatre of operation. He  was transferred to Admiralty in London in 1942. Carnap 
possibly acquired some  pessimism after the Great War. After all, the Germans 
lost. This contrasts  with the strange optimism felt by the Brits in the 
post-war period. Grice  included. They were grown up, they had been forced to 
grow up too soon. Yet they  had not been able to develop their philosophical 
talents. Now in their thirties,  a whole generation had been devastated. 
They had no time to lose. Grice's  efforts were directed at the formation of a 
new generation of philosophers at  Oxford -- along with his current fare of 
unappointed tuttees. Strawson was  Grice's favourite student, and the one 
which gave some sense to his rambling  life. At the senior level, the 
influence of Austin was  paramount. 
Generation  Gap and All. The Overlap. Carnap gave three renowned lectures 
in London in 1934. This  Grice must have been aware of. He was in his early 
20s, then, but I’d think Ayer  would have made the thing known in Oxford. 
Grice was VERY  concerned with  what Austin was doing -- before the Phoney war.

The  Oxford Circle. The Berkeley Circle. If Carnap was ultimately Vienna 
Circle,  there’s more of a larger geographical spectrum in Grice. "The Carnap 
Circle" --  by this we mean the Carnap convivial approach to philosophy. 
This is echoed in  the Grice Circle. Grice could only work philosophically in 
convivial conditions.  Although he never belonged to the early Austin club, 
he was a regular, indeed,  Austin's favourite member of Austin's playgroup. 
On Austin's death, Grice indeed  led the playgroup until his departure for 
the States. What's more important,  while in the States he would gather at his 
"at-homes" up the Berkeley Hills.  It's less clear what sort of convivial 
meeetings Carnap held while at Santa  Monica, etc. 
>From  Oxford to the New World – but back. Carnap  observes that the state 
of Logic teaching in  the USA was much better than  in Europe. This is echoed 
by Grice. He confesses publicly that part of his  professional reason -- 
one wonders:  couldn't he just write? -- for moving  to the States was "closer 
contact 
with  logicians". Grice is already in  1969 quoting from Boolos, Parsons, 
Myro, Mates, etc.  This is the beginning  of his System G. Putnam would 
actually represss Grice's formalistic fancies  short: "You are too formal" he'd 
complain. Grice did not fit  the brit  steroretype of the good humanistic 
Oxford don of the 
Austinian ilk. Of   course they were wrong. Grice fit NO stereotype. Etc.

Diagogism. The  diagogic. Further to the gladiatorial and the 
conversational, it is  worth  pointing out that the later Grice grew less and less 
tolerant of 'epagoge'   and more and more embracing of diagoge. The distinction is 
Aristotelian,  but  Grice's twist reminds one of Carnap's pro-attitude for 
dialogue  as   stimulating. Grice's  father had been a musician and so was 
his younger brother Derek.  The trios  they engaged in in Harborne gave Grice 
a rich ... (thing) about the value of  cooperation: "Getting together to do 
philosophy should be like getting  to  play music". The epagoge/diagoge 
distinction is a basic one for Grice's  metaphysical  methodology. If evidence 
is, as the neo-Kantian he was, all  too clearly  
necessary, one would hope however that the BASIS for this  or that 
metaphysical  claim (or rejection) should rest on its own virtues  rather than on 
the success  or failure of having confronted its  antithesis. 
Grice  on Kant. The  double influence.The influence of Kant on Grice was a 
later one. As an Oxonian,  Kant was not really taken too seriously. In this 
respect, Carnap's education was  more traditionally philosophical (His PhD 
which Grice never attained, was  published in Kant Studien). Grice first came 
to the proximities of Kant via  Abbott's translation, and thus he was more 
of a minor Kantian than Carnap was,  who could savour Kant in the 
vernacular! -- In 1966, Sir Peter Strawson, Grice's  former student, published his 
"Bounds of Sense" which brought Kant to the  Oxonian map. Grice will later be 
invited to deliver the Kant Lectures at  Stanford. But  importantly for the 
present conversation: while it was Kant's 'theoretical'  reason that only 
influenced Carnap, Kant's influence on Grice was just as strong  on the 
theoretical if not MORE in the practical realm. Grice, unlike  Carnap, looked for 
the UNITY of reason and justification in all  our attitudes: not just 
doxastic, but notably boulomaic. THis is a strong  contrast with Carnap. His 
neo-Kantianism was theoretical in nature: aimed at  epistemological problems 
concerning space/time coordinates as Carnap  found had to be 'vamped out' to deal 
with discoveries by Einstein, etc.  -- But Carnap remained an irrationalist 
in matters of value and  ethics. Grice on the other hand possibly had with 
Kant the insight of the  categorial imperative: the dark starry night sky 
above us. 
Grice  on Frege. Frege was of course one of the inspiring models for 
Carnap. For  Grice the Frege influence came much later. There is one single ref. 
to Frege by  Grice in his "Prejudices and Predilections" and this only in 
connection with the  idea of the Fregean 'sense' -- he writes, "in something 
like a Fregean sense".  Grice is considering, however, one of his 
'metaphysical' routines. His Humean  projection is supposed to deliver concepts alla 
Fregean senses. E.g. the concept  of negation, the concept of value, the 
concept of -- you name  it. 
Grice  on Russell. Russell as Lingua Franca between Carnap and Grice. 
Russell has to be  the lingua franca Carnap/Grice. Russell's influence on Carnap, 
which was  actually two-way, was invaluable. Carnap was the Russelian par 
excellence. The  influence of Russell on Grice is much more roundabout. Grice 
got an interest in  Russell's modernism, as he calls it, after Strawson had 
challenged it in Intro  to logical theory (1952), which was as influential 
in Oxford as Carnap's Intro  to Semantics had been in the USA. Take the FL   
vs   NL.  Grice is clear in the ideology behind this. There's what he calls 
Modernism and  Neo-Modernism. This is Russell and the heirs of PM. This 
INCLUDES, almost by  antonomasia, CARNAP. But then there's neo-Traditionalism, 
and earlier,  Traditionalism. By this Grice means Aristotelian logic (made 
respectable by  Lukasiewicz) and Strawson's and indeed Oxonian 
ordinary-language philosophical  logic. 
--  the idea that '\&', 'v', --$>$ -- the connectives in the syntax of FL -- 
do  not correspond to the vernaculars of NL 'and', 'or', 'if'. Vide Carnap on 
this  for a formalist (vs informalist) view. Grice came to prefer the  
modernism-traditionalism distinction to his earlier formalim-informalism. The  
important thing here is not so much the labels for these sorts of betes 
noires,  but Grice's own brand: the way he saw or presented himself "in society" 
-- and  what he called the longitudinal history of philosophy: "a foot in 
each camp", he  jokes. But in essence, that's the aptest description of his 
position. For his  System G-- complete with a pragmatics, allows to maintain 
that the alleged  divergences between NL and FL are a matter of 
'implicature' rather than logical  form.  At the end of the Gricean  day, Grice's  
attitude towards Russell is ambivalent. The most  provocative Grice could  get 
was in his "Definite descriptions in Russell and the  
vernacular",  -- 1970. Grice was ambivalent because Russell himself was. He 
had attacked  Grice's student publicly ("Mr. Strawson on referring", Mind.  
While Grice  disagreed with Strawson over details, he was of course going 
to  align with  Strawson against Russell who was giving the Oxford school of 
ordinary   language philosophy some good press that actually worked very 
well for  Grice's  professional life. So he had to be careful. His sympathies 
were  for a  formalistic approach to languages alla Russell and as evidenced 
in  his System  G. But his 'pro-attitude' was institutional and he felt he  
NEEDED to  self-present as an ordinary-language philosopher, even if with  
very big  caveats. 
Grice  and the Morris connection. The connection here is pretty 
interseting. While  every schoolboy knows that Quine was THE logical positivist in the 
USA, Morris  also visited both Vienna and Prague. The connection with Grice 
here is more  indirect. But typically Gricean rather than triggered, as poor 
Grice often was,  by Strawsonians whims. Grice had read Stevenson's Ethics 
and language (1944),  which was an offshot of Morris's teaching. In 1948, 
Grice lectured publicly for  the Oxford Philosophical Society on "Meaning": he 
is opposing some simplified  accounts of things he found in STevenson -- 
but which he in private lectures at  Oxford --  had extended to cover Morris, 
and still earlier, Peirce. The  project of the unified science which was so 
Morrisian and Carnapian is less easy  to detect in Grice. HIs treatment of 
the ethical views of Stevenson, however,  shows his sympathy with a 
philosophy that is at least ready and willing to be  able to discourse on both 
matters alethic and practic. 
Grice  on Tarski. Lingua Franca gets an accent, or Tarski disquoted. The 
influence of  Tarski on Grice is much more roundoubt. Again, the trigger was 
his rebel  student, Strawson. In a famous talk at Bristol, much much later 
revisited  by Warnock ("Bristol Revisited", in refs.) Strawson opposed 
Austin's  correspondence theory of truth. Strawson argued that 'is true' was  
illocutionary in nature. This puzzles historians of philosophy as it would have  
been natural to to think AUSTIN would have embraced such a view. Yet,  
Austin, like Grice, were traditionalists in these. Grice dedicates a whole  
section of his third William James lecture to a discussion of Tarski. Grice ends  
up endorsing a neo-Tarskian view. The sentence of Tarski becomes an 
utterance in  Grice, but the basic Tarskian idea of 'satisfactoriness' is retained 
by Grice  --. He even goes on to propose some implicatural solutions to 
formal problems  having to do with blind uses of the metalogical predicate 
'true' in NL:  "What the policeman said was true". Much later, when generalising 
what he  now called "alethic satisfactoriness", he introduces special 
apparatus to his  System G to deal with satisfactoriness in realms other than the 
alethic,  notably the practical.  
Grice  on Wittgenstein. “Not my man”. Wittgenstein, or Witters as the more 
irreverent  Grice would have it. Again, Carnap's contact was literally 
first hand. Grice  was a closet Wittgensteinian. One reads his "Method in 
philosohical  psychology" and finds whoe passages verbatim from Witters without a 
recogntion  (well, once). Grice would often quote from Witters. He is listed 
as an  A-philosopher against which Grice reacts in the William James 
lectures. First  Wittgenstein, Last Wittgenstein, Middle Wittgenstein. The 
refinements of  Witters' philosophy are important for our reconstruction of the 
Griceland of  Carnapcopia. --- The first Wittgenstein falls squrely in the FL 
project of  Modernism. The middle Wittgenstein is the critical ie. crisis -- 
Witters. The  later Wittgenstein possibly had  a stronger influence on Grice 
than on  Carnap. 
Grice  on Hempel and Reichenbach. Grice cites Hempel and Reichenbach re: 
atomistic  metaphysics in his "actions and events" PPQ, 1986.  
Grice  on Quine, Grice on Chomsky. While  Carnap would write, "The men who 
had the strongest  influence on my  philosophical thinking were Frege and 
Russell" in that order,  Grice could  be more irreverent. A 1913-born man 
finds the strongest influence in  a  linguist born in the 1930s: Noam Chomsky 
and the Vienna Circle refugee:  Quine.  --"I have to admit" Grice writes (or 
words), that what "I admired  in them is  their method -- never their ideas, 
which I never respected,  really". Grice's choice is particularly agonistic: 
in the sense that it provokes  sheer agony in  us: "for I never ... over 
the fact that these two genii  never agreed ON  ANYTHING". And they lived so 
close!

Secularism.  Grice's religious inclinations are harder to pin down than 
Carnap’s. Chapman in  fact sounds rather authoritative when she states that 
"Grice lost all faith by  the age of 19" or something. You can never be so 
sure. Chapman redeems herself  by noting the very many religious references, 
eschatological and Biblical, in  Grice's various writings. While a disbeliever 
in God, Grice liked to play God.  Borrowing on this idea by Carnap of 
pirots which karulize elatically, Grice  founds a full programme in the vein of 
the ideal-observer. What we would do, as  God, to secure the survival of 
pirots. While not religious in nature, it has a  religious tone that is absent 
in the writings of Carnap in any  respect. 
Scholasticism  rears its pretty face. how many angels could dance on the 
point of a needle.  Grice cites the same example. In "Prejudices and 
Predilections". To consider:  Longitudinal unity/latitudinal unity. Metaphysics is 
important for Grice as a  manifestation of philosophy's latitudinal unity: 
everything connects and  metaphysics is the ground-floor discipline: the 
theory-theory or first  philosophy. But unlike Carnap, Grice was an inveterate 
historicisit. He rejoiced  in what he called the longitudinal unity of 
philosophy which Carnap repudiated.  Grice found inspiration in time-honoured 
philosophies of Socrates, Plato,  Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, (Grice to 
the) Mill, etc. These he called  'the great'. He was less tolerant with the 
minors -- among which he  provocatively lists Witters! 
 

More  on the pirot talk. Vis a vis Carnap’s focus on relations in his 1929  
Abriss der Logistik, Grice expands on the pirots that karulise elatically. 
These  can potch and cotch and fed – where Fed is a variable for a relation 
ship. in  Carnap's sense. Grice made this public in the Lectures on Language 
and Reality  in a  memorable summer symposium in Irvine in 1971. etc. 
Can  pirots implicate? Bar-Hillel  is cited by Chapman in connection with a 
possible influence of Carnap on Grice.  Bar-Hillel had worked with Carnap 
and comes out with this idea that the  divergence between FL and NL is in the 
'implicature'. He uses 'implication' and  it's the idea of pragmatics as 
the wastebasket of philosophers. Grice on  metaphysical excrescences. etc.

\section{Dialogue}

I.e. your gladiatorial thing as thesis. With a reference to Aristotle  
'epagoge' which I think will look cute in Greek letters.
 
Then the second paragraph is your conversation thing -- with Aristotle's  
"diagoge" in Greek letters. which will look cute.
 
The synthesis is: sort of what you say about this being an "imaginary"  
conversation along these lines. To sound good literary, we can drop the Landor  
reference in the references:
 
   Landor, Imaginary Conversations.
 
 The epagoge/diagoge distinction used by Grice bears on this. It may be best 
 provided some formalisation. Let 'c1' be claim c as put forward by 
philosopher C  (Carnap). Let c2 be claim as put forward by philosopher G (Grice)
 
                  C                         G
 
                  c1                        c2
 
In the epagoge model, c2 only attains sense vis a vis c1. G's claim to fame 
 is seen as C's claim to infame, and vice versa. The epagoge works indeed  
gladiatorially: the success of c2 is in the defeat of c1 and vice versa. It 
is a  zero-sum game, where game is loosely understood as such. More like a 
mediaeval  joust, if you ask us.
 
In the diagoge model, we need to add pieces of evidence, e1 and e2. So we  
get
 
                   C                          G
 
  e1  ---->    c1                          c2  <---- e2
 
 The success of each claim does depend on the strength and virtue of  their 
own corresponding backings. But we feel we need a synthesis to the  
epagoge-diagoge dialectic then. For there are issues regarding the  
incommensurability of the respective pieces of evidence and the topicalisation  issue (are 
c1 and c2 about the same thing -- or is Grice changing the  {\it subject}). 
Last but not least, there is the question as to to what extent this  is just 
"imaginary". After all, we are building a bridge: looking for some sort  of 
'actual' conversation, and it seems that we still have C with his c1 and e1  
on one hand and G with his c2 and e2 on the other. So what gives? We propose  
then a sort of criss-crossing. Where we add e1' : i.e. evidence derived  
from c1 as it supports or fails to support c2. And we add e2', i.e.  evidence 
as derived from c2 which supports or fails to support c1.  Only when we 
reach this level of bridging can we say that G is  conversing with C and vice 
versa:
 
                    C                   G
 
  e1                                                e2
      .                                           .
        .                                     .
           .                               .
                c1                    c2
                   .                      .
                       .               .
                        e1'   e2'

which is to come, delivered under  the similitude of a dream, wherein is 
discovered, the manner of his setting out,  his dangerous journey; and safe 
arrival at the desired countrey. London:  Nash.

[As early as] 1946, Bar-Hillel [was discussing] the sense of 'imply'  
identified by Moore, proposing to describe it as 'pragmatical' (p. 334).  He 
identifies himself as a supporter of 'logical empiricism' (he  quotes 
approvingly a comment from Carnap to the effect that  natural languages are TOO 
COMPLEX and MESSY to be the focus of rigorous  scientific enquiry) and his 
article ['Analysis of "correct"  language'. Mind 55 328-30) is aimed explicitly at 
REJECTING philosophy of  the 'analytic method' ... However, he suggests 
that by using sentences that are  'MEANINGLESS' to logical empiricists, such as 
the sentences of METAPHYSICS or  [worse, JLS] aesthetics [never mind 
'ethics'. JLS], 'one may nevertheless  imply [empahsis Bar-Hillel. JLS] 
sentences which are PERFECTLY MEANINGFUL,  according to the same criteria, and are 
perhaps even true and highly important'  (p.338). -- cited by Chapman in her 
book on Grice.


Empiricism.  This is the first bête noire. But Grice fails to mention his 
twin: Rationalism.  There is some mystifying about ‘empeira’, as the Greeks 
used the word. Peira is  ultimately a tribunal. There is nothing to scary 
about having a doctrine based  upon the idea of a tribunal.  
Extensionalism.  While Grice lists this, he fails again to mention the 
twin: Intensionalism.  Grice was not necessarily attracted to Intensionalism. So 
his rejection of  Extensionalism is indeed a case of his epagoge, trying to 
refute a thesis rather  than provide positive evidence for its contrary. 
The root ‘tensio’, that is  common to both bêtes noires is an interesting 
one, and related to the deeper  questions about meaning. 
Functionalism.  Again it’s difficult to see what twin bête Grice is having 
in mind. Not  Formalism, but indeed, the standard antonymy is form versus 
function. As per  Aristotle. Thus, think of ‘cabbage’. What is the function 
of a cabbage? To  cabbagise, Grice suggests (2001 – of cabbages and kings). 
Oddly, while Grice  sees functionalism as a bête noire, the Original 
Christian found “Formalist”. We  read from Bunyan: “And as [Christian] was troubled 
thereabout, he espied  two men come tumbling over the wall, on the left 
hand of the narrow way; and  they made up apace to him. The name of the one was 
Formalist”. But what Bunyan  is having in mind of course is mere Dogmatism. 
Something to consider here is  that Grice may have thought that 
Functionalism is Not Enough. Thus, when B. F.  Loar, for example defines simple things 
like Grice’s conversational maxims as  “empirical generalisations over 
functional states” (Mind and Meaning, Cambridge  University Press) we know that 
that will leave Grice cold. He is going to look  for a deeper explanation 
than that. 
Materialism. When  it comes to this ism, again it’s interesting not just to 
consider the twin, but  the root. After all, Grice was an Aristotelian, and 
matter is all there is for  Aristotle: the hule. So ‘Hylism’ would be a 
better term. At least less hybrid.  By rejecting Hylism, Grice may be again 
saying that it is insufficient rather  than wrong. After all for Aristotle, 
who played with ‘hule’, we need the basic  compound: matter and form: hyle 
and morph. But doesn’t “hylomorphism” sounds as  a scarier bete than Hylism? 
Mechanism. Indeed  one bete noire destroyed by another. Antonym here: 
Telism. I.e. the idea that  final causes are all we need.  The  root of mechanism 
in the Greek idea of mekhane is not as bad after all.   
Naturalism. Twin  bete noire: non-naturalism, as per Moore’s 
non-naturalistic fallacy which Grice  rejects in “Conception of Value”: ‘value’ cannot 
be non-natural, as Moore would  think about this. Grice’s sympathies were for 
constructed entities – and  constructivist approaches to value in 
particular along the lines made familiar  in Oxford by J. L. Mackie and Philippa Foot 
(both authors he mainly focuses on  in (1991)). 
Nominalism. Is he  thinking of Realims as the twin bete noire? One thinks 
so. But Grice came only  at a very late stage to become a realist, and with 
caveats. He never was the  closet realist that Davidson was (Speranza here 
recalls his conversations with  Davidson on this on occasion of Speranza 
delivering his very first Gricean paper  – in, of all places, Buenos Aires!)(vide 
Speranza 1989). Grice was no realist in  that he thought that realism 
needed some transcendental justification: our  beliefs have to be true because 
they would be useless if they weren’t. Similarly  he never abandoned the idea 
that only via sense-data do material objects enter  our cognitive schemes: 
objects threaten and nourish us: sense data don’t. If the  opposition is with 
realia over universalia, I would think Grice was enough of an  occamist 
(would you modify Occam’s razor if you were not?) to throw the baby  with the 
water. 
Phenomenalism. The  funny bit about this that here we do have a case where 
both a bete noire and her  twin (Physicalism) both scare the Christian in 
Grice! Strictly, the perfect  antonym, at least for Kant, for this would be 
Noumenalism, as per “Philosophy  4”. A caveat however is in order: noumenon 
does not really oppose phainomenon,  at least for the Grecians. Noumenon is 
the realm of thought. So it’s Mentalism  which the proper bete noire would 
be. Incidentally, Mentalism can claim however,  the status of the twin for the 
bete noire of Physicalism,  too. 
Positivism.  However, it may do here to consider  betes noires that one 
usually associates with Positivism, too. Inductivism,  Confirmationism, etc. 
What about Popper’s falsificationism? Is this a twin bete  noire here? It 
seems so. Strictly, the anonym for falsificationism would be  confirmationalism. 
 
Physicalism. The  source for this all “Prejudices and predilections”, now 
safely deposited at BANC  90/35c, was triggered by a request by Grandy and 
Warner, so Grice may have been  in a hurry. For indeed, a hasty etymological 
ramble leads you to conclude that  Naturalism and Physicalism are two ugly 
rearing heads of the SAME bete. “phusis”  of the Grecians was the Nature of 
the Romans.   
Reductionism. His  twin, irreductionism, is just as scary. It would seem 
that indeed, analysis is  what bridges C and G. So that an irreducible feature 
is a non-sequitur.  Perhaps the clearest Grice gets on this  is his reply 
to Davidson on intending. Davidson, who was perhaps Grice’s soul  mate more 
than anyone else while at Berkeley, Grice found reductionist. And this  in 
the sense, that Davidson went for the bigger picture, failing to see the  
leaves for the tree. His account of volition, for example, Grice finds obscenely 
 reductionist. Grice has manifestos to the effect: (words). “Not that 
Davidson’s  picture is wrong; it’s just too simple: surely when I inspect my 
mind and see  all the volitional things that I associate it with, there’s no 
big core picture  in terms of the desirability operator that Davidson is 
claiming is basic”. So  the anti-reductionist Grice is wanting to say that the 
richness of the  phenomenon (or better,  phenomena)  in question has to be 
given proper due before going for the easy way out of a  reductive (even) 
explanation. 
Scepticism. Twin  bete noire? Dogmatism, just as bad. Alla Grandy (cited by 
Grice, WoW:xix) we can  say that it’s Underdog-matism, with Grice, but yet. 
The idea behind ‘scepsis’  was not that bad: it was a thorough (but not 
perhaps that thorough, for Grice)  examination. His caveats for anti-sceptical 
views however were clear in those  essays Grice cared to reprint in WoW 
that bear titles like, “Common sense and  scepticism”. As a autobiographical 
reminder, Speranza should here disclose that  indeed he felt very close to 
Grice when he realised that the topic of scepticism  had fascinated Grice, as 
it had fascinated Speranza, from a tender age. “Common  sense and scepticism”
 Grice dates as 1946. I.e. the third or fourth piece he  produced. His 
first being “Negation” 1938. Grice’s arguments therein are  directed towards 
Norman Malcom’s assuming the Moorean position of the Ordinary  Languager 
versus Phyrro. 
I enjoyed your three points re: Carnap's thing. Will see what I can say  
about it from G's perspective. (Oddly Grice uses initials a lot: he has M, A, 
R,  U, G., in his Retrospective Epilogue. So surely he would not object to 
C. He  distinguishes between G and G* but I forget what the distinction 
amounts  to.
 
technical. While Carnap has these as applying to 'rejection', in a more  
charitable light we can see the labels as applying to approaches. It seems  
plausible to entertain the idea that it takes a metaphysical stand to reject  
another. So what's the technical side to this. G would surely oppose a  
characterisation of metaphysics as the realm of 'synthetic' truths. If anything  
of value, metaphysics has to transcend that realm. In the way that 
Nietzsche  said (we think) that morality was beyond evil and good. The 
analytic-synthetic  distinction must be one of the first offshots of our metaphysical 
thinking, so  it cannot be presupposed by it! Now C's way out here, the 
distinction between  'necessary' and 'analytic' would be one that may perhaps 
appeal G. We mean, he  was one for splitting anyday (never lump). Assuming a 
retreat to 'analytic'  would be viscious here (or vascuous, if you want), we 
are left with 'necessary'.  Now, this operator Grice found increasingly 
complex. C's idea that it deals with  the denotatum rather than the denotans is 
one which would have appealed G.  Echoes of ratio essendi come to mind. Grice 
was hoping (recall Hopeful is  Christian's soul mate in his pilgrimage to 
the Celestial City) that philosophy  (or metaphysics, specifically) could 
provide a backing for ratio as apply to  esse not just {\it cognoscere}. While 
C's would have had the knee jerk reaction,  "Scholastic!" this need not be so. 
The idea is that while 'must' (the token of  'necessity' as it were) 
applies to various realms but it's not for that reason  'aequivocal'. It is rather 
{\it aequi-}vocal: i.e. the same vox for various items.  There is ontological 
necessity, there is cognitive necessity, there is logical  necessity 
('analyticity' in C's jargon). So what gives. Grice would go on to  define 
metaphysics as that part of the discipline of the philosopher, perhaps  qua 
eschatologist, which defines the axioms for our understanding of 'must'.  When and 
how are we ready to postulate an item as {\it deontic}. Deontic is the  
adjective that would have appealed Grice at this point. It's the deon of the  
Greeks: the idea that some things are, some others must be. The  internal-external 
distinction C draws at this point would have sounded to G "a  mere 
Hartism". Hart had distinguished between internal and external readings of  things 
(notably ascriptions of right: "Carnap is right" "Carnap is wrong". On an  
internal reading, we assume he is wrong. On an external reading we assume 
that  someone assumes he is wrong. Grice discusses this feature of 'deontic' 
in  connection with Nixon being appointed the Professor of Moral philosophy 
at  Oxford! (Grice 2001). The levels of internal, external, and 
middle-of-the-way  readings are formidably complex as Grice was wont to say. But in any 
case, the  offshot is that the 'deontic' operator need not be 
self-referential: i.e. it's  not like our grasp of the meaning of 'deontic' involves our 
acceptance of  'deontic' as deontic at a higher level. Ultimately Grice would 
have appealed to  a mere reiteration of symbols. Some operators are not 
deontic. Notably the  boulomaic operators, the volitional operators. What we 
decide or deem that  we'll do. This is mere volitional. But volitional 
predicates have the ability to  go recursive. We decide to decide. And we decide 
to decide to decide. When this  iteration is given free reign, we find that 
we have cashed the deontic operator  out of the boulomaic operator. This type 
of transcategorial epithets would  thus define the 'necessity' which we 
associate with this or that metaphysical  scheme. In G's case, his hidden 
agenda is not so hidden: he wants to license the  metaphysics (or physics as he 
would sometime say) underlying English! (The sun  rises from the East -- will 
we still be using 'rise' knowing that that is NOT  what it does? Isn't this 
getting involved in stone-age physics? Whatever. But  that is not a serious 
issue. More serious is the inability of ordinary English  speakers to go 
beyond the solid 'table'. The solid 'table' is what we mean by  table. If it 
turns out that Eddington is right (as he most likely is) and the  real table 
is a bunch of wavicles, we may still want to keep using the  metaphysical 
scheme that we inherited from our ancestors -- cavemen no doubt --  out of 
respect for them, and because if we are not that dumb we know how to  
translate one metaphysical scheme onto antoher!
 
intuitive approach. There is something to be said for Carnap's gut  
rejection for metaphysics. His claim to fame is actually his laughing at  
Heidegger's Nothing Noths. So we could consider this in more detail. German:  Nicht 
nichtet. This was thought serious enough by Ryle when he cared to review  
Heidegger for Mind. But what does "Nicht nichtet" amount to? At this point,  
Bar-Hillel's throwing onto the same wastebasket 'metaphysics' and 'ethics' or  
aesthetics, won't do. Carnap is a much more serious philosopher than early  
Ayer's caricature of the statements of ethics as "ouch" and "pooh!". But 
there  is more to consider here. In this work we cannot hope to cover all 
realms of  statements, so we better focus on allegedly metaphysical statement or 
 pseudostatements (schein- is the lovely suffix for Carnap here) of 
metaphysics.  So what's wrong with "Nothing noths". Carnap thinks this breaks a 
rule of  grammar. And it does! Heidegger MEANT it as a breach of a rule of 
grammar.  Heidegger kept saying these things, to the point that, no C, but G, 
could laugh  at him when he said, "Heidegger is the greatest living 
philosopher" (in WoW:i).  So what was Heidegger up to. We believe he was PLAYING with 
the rules of  grammar. He is into "not". "Not" is a trick of a word. He had 
an intuitive, or  gutty feel for language as play. So out of "not" he coins 
the noun, "nought".  Nicht". (Nought is a complex word in English, involving 
ne- and aught. I.e. Not  Something -- No-Thing. Noths. But what about the 
verb, 'noths'. Well, it does  seem like a thing Nothingness would do. To do 
nothing. To who? G was fascinated  by the grammar of verbal constructions. He 
played with things like 'tigers  tigerise' (1991:x). So he wouldn't have 
objected, upon proper understanding of  what rules we are 'flouting' here -- 
with a sprinkling of Strawson's "Subject  and predicate in logic and grammar" 
for good measure -- to utter, "Nichts  nichtet". It's like, if you can't 
beat them, join them.
 
radical approach. G would have enjoyed that. Indeed Bradley for G, and  
Heidegger for C are what we may call arch- or ur-metaphysicians. Recall G's 
WoW:  "nobody since the demise of the influence of Bradley was even remotely 
inclined  to believe that", where we don't even need to care {\it what the claim 
Was}. Some  absurd extravaganza. This is amusing, because we do know that 
both C and G did  care for their ancestors. C for Kant's and Neo-Kant's 
extravaganzas, G for  Bradley (eg. on 'negation' or 'deixis'). So it was more of a 
pose, that, we can  say, get the headlines. The various readings of C's 
specifics in his  "Ontological" essay would have amused G. Indeed Quine could 
get over the top  about what 'there is' -- a seminal work that both C and Q 
were very aware of.  But C's radicalism was perhaps more 'intuitive' -- if we 
can lump these two  labels here -- than G's. G would have examined what we 
mean by 'real' or  'really' when C's claim, on the serious reading of his 
"Ontology" paper, that  this or that 'does not really exist'. As opposed to 
th'other 'does really  exist'. After all, why, G would have it, should we give 
such a hoot to a mere  'trouser-word' such as 'real' is? Surely our radical 
opposition to a campaign as  serious as metaphysics is presented to be (by 
metaphysicians, no doubt) should  rest on something more substantial than 
that. The topic of the evidence gets us  closer to the nail we need to hit. 
This is back to some of Grice's betes noires  (Phenomenalism, indeed) -- but 
again, a close examination at how language works  does suggest a neat way out. 
For we claim the denotata of our terms to go beyond  the evidence we may 
have (or lack) to 'assert' the 'warrantibility' of our  claims. "The cat is on 
the mat". No intension here makes a strict reference as  to how we get to 
KNOW that. It's here where an examination of the 'simpler ways'  in which 
'pirots karulise elatically' will, we hope, eventually land us on the  
Celestial City. And then, wouldn't we find it boring enough that we are going to  
scream alla Heidegger! ("Out! Get me Out of Here!"). Etc

This quote from WoW:then
 
 
"(Mrs. Jack)," Grice says,

"also reproves me for "reductionism," in terms which suggest that  whatever 
account or ANALYSIS of meaning is to be offered, it should not be one  
which is 'reductionist,' which might or might not be equivalent to a demand that 
 a PROPER analysis should not be a PROPER REDUCTIVE ANALYSIS. But what KIND 
of  analysis is to be provided? What I think we cannot agree to allow her 
to do is  to pursue the goal of giving a LAX REDUCTIVE ANALYSIS of meaning , 
that is, a  reductive analysis which is UNHAMPERED by the contraints which  
characteristically attach to reductive analysis, like the avoidance of  
circularity; a goal, to which, to my mind several of my opponents have in fact  
addressed themsleves ((In this connection, I should perhaps observe that 
though  MY EARLY ENDEAVOURS in the theory of meaning were attempts to provide a 
 REDUCTIVE analysis, I HAVE NEVER (I THINK) espoused {\it reductionism}, which 
to my  mind involves the idea that semantic concepts are unsatisfactory or 
even  UNINTELLIGIBLE, unless they can be provided with interpretations in 
terms of  some predetermined, privileged, and favoured array of concepts; in 
this sense of  "reductionism" a felt ad hoc need for reductive analysis does 
NOT have to rest  on a REDUCTIONIST foundation. Reductive analysis might be 
called for to get away  from unclarity not to get to some predesignated 
clarifiers)). I shall for the  moment assume that the demand that I face is for a 
form of REDUCTIVE analysis  which is less grievously flawed than the one 
which I in fact offered; and I  shall reserve until later considerations of 
the idea that what is needed is NOT  any kind of reductive analysis but rather 
some other mode of explication of the  concept of meaning" (WoW:351).

\paragraph{Clarification}
 
In this respect, it is clarificatory that, for Grice, as for Carnap,  
psychological concepts should be introduced as theoretical terms, rather than  
as ones based on observation. The locus classicus here is Grice's use of  
Ramsification to introduce T terms in terms of O terms (in Grice 1991). 

We like the idea  that indeed Grice is perhaps slightly hasty in dealing 
with all the betes noires  at one fell swoop as it were, or at the one blading 
of the sword. 
 
The fact that all  of the betes noires end in -ism is perhaps telling. This 
is a Greek suffix,  -ismos which of course Grice would NOT reject in other 
collocations: his beloved  Aristotelian 'syllogismos' for example. So we 
have to be  careful.
 
Grice seems to  consider that besides this common mark -- they all end in 
-ism, they may also  all be seen as the offsprings of "Minimalism" -- his 
rejection of desserted, or  made-dessert landscapes (the rosebushes and 
cherry-trees in the springtime). We  shall have to get back there.
 
\section{Beyond the Pirot talk}

CHAPTER  FOUR: BEYOND THE PIROT TALK.
As  we have seen (3.2.2.1 – i.e. our reactions to extensionalism) there are 
broader  issues here. To what extent will an intensionalist NOT feel 
betrayed by an  intensionalist. Some of the most formidable passages in WoW:RE 
deal with this.  He is here concerned with what we may see as an ‘intensional’
, i.e.  non-truth-functional context. But we’ll need to elaborate on that. 
On p. 374 of  WoW:RE he writes:

“A truth-functional conception of COMPLEX propositions  offers prospects, 
perhaps, for the rational construction of at least part of the  realm of 
propositions, even though the fact that many complex propositions SEEM  PLAINLY 
to be NON-truth-funtctional ensures that many problems  remain” 
---  the naivete of Grice is formidable here. For he is saying that 
something is  plainy or SEEMS plainly thus and thus. By what evidence. It seems 
that whatever  evidence he has to SAY that is of a different kind from the 
evidence he is  supporting as providing a ‘rational construction’. Etc. I would 
think that  whatever Carnap had as an intensional context would fit the 
bill here in not  being truth-functional. One is less sure that G would have 
been happy with a  mere extensional treatment of modal propositions.  Etc.
 
\paragraph{Un-Carnapian Grice}

"The un-Carnapian character of my
constructivism would perhaps  be
evidenced by my idea that to insist
with respect to each [pirotic]  stage
in metaphysical develoment
upon the need for
THEORETICAL  JUSTIFICATION
might carry with it the thought
that to omit such a  stage
would be to fail to do justice
to some legitimate
metaphysical  demand"
    (Gr91:76)
 
>  "The un-Carnapian character of my
> constructivism 
 
 
----
he is thinking that Carnap was such a pragmatist that he was into  
'theoretical justifications' being practical?
 

would  perhaps  be
> evidenced by my idea that to insist
> with  respect to each [pirotic]  stage
> in metaphysical  development
---
 
this in the context of what you were asking
before about the objectivity of
value judgements. Grice is introducing
'pirots' or creatures the last
stage of which will endow them
with a capacity to project
values onto the world
(and thus turn them objective
via construction).
 
 
---
> upon the need for
> THEORETICAL   JUSTIFICATION
> might carry with it the thought
> that to omit  such a  stage
> would be to fail to do justice
> to some  legitimate
> metaphysical  demand"
  --- yes here it is where he gets complex. For he uses
  too many neg. constructions,
   omit, fail to do... etc.
  omit and fail are so negative that one wonders...
    he is saying that not to omit is not to fail
            to  include is to succeed
 So he is saying that by including value-thus construed
      he IS fulfilling a demand.
 
--- I think the carnapian would say
  that if there is no theoretical justification
 one would not be succeeding.

Anyway, we will provide such a detailed exegesis that the reader will  omit 
to fail to understand it, for she will!
