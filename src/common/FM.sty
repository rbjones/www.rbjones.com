%% FM style file is in various parts:
%% **	to set page sizes large
%% **	to redefine some LaTeX article style commands
%% **	for defining frameworks for page headers and footers
%% **	for FM style front page
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% For big pages
%% **	Uses more of the page for text.
%% **	No margins.
%% **	Have vertical space between paragraphs, and no hanging indents.
%% **	Alter table of contents and bibliography commands to not
%%	produce any section titles.
%% **	Make footnote separating rule full page width.
%% ** 	Show dates.

%  `\FormatDate{}' formats a date in the style: `YY/MM/DD', as
%	produced by sccs and similar, in the form `DD Monthname 19YY'.
%	If the argument is empty (as in `\FormatDate{}') then today's
%	date is used.  Thus a good way to use it in an sccs controlled
%	document is with the `percent E percent' keyword (for the
%	next few lines `%' will be shown as `*' so that sccs will not
%	expand `*E*' in this explanatory text):
%		\FormatDate{*E*
%		} 
%	So that if the *E* macro has not been expanded you get today's
%	date, because the first `percent' is taken as TeX's start of
%	comment.
%
%	Note the `\number#3\relax\space' for the day.  The `\number#3'
%	part removes any leading zeroes and trailing spaces in argument
%	3.  Leading zeroes come from SCCS.  Trailing spaces may come
%	from the `*E*\n}' where the `\n' is treated as a space, in an
%	alternative form of `{*E**\n}' the extra `*' (actually `%')
%	means that there is no space.  The definition of `\number' is
%	that it allows, and consumes <one optional space> (see the
%	TeXbook, page 269), without the `\relax' then that space may be
%	the explicit one we give here.  The combination of `\number'
%	and `\relax' means that trailing spaces are suppressed, and
%	that one space is included between day and month.
%
%	This is now extended to cope with inputs of the form `YY/MM/DD'
%	or `YYYY/MM/DD' optionally followed by a space then something else.
%	The something else is discarded. This caters for RCS Date substitutions
%	which include a time after the date. FormatDateAux requires a space
%	after operand 3. FormatDate tacks on a date and a dummy operand 4
%	to cater for the SCCS format with no time field. If the time field
%	is their TeX matches the first space and so discards the time
%	along with the dummy operand.
%	To permit RCS style keywords in documents checked for editing
%	an argument beginning with a $ is also permitted and treated
%	the same as an empty argument. Use `co -kv' with RCS to get
%	the proper dates inserted when the document has been checked in.

%%	Style to generate front pages of documents in the FM
%%	document style.  Based on [AW...] issue ..., version...
%%
%% **	Defines lots of macros, general style is that macros with an
%%	`@' are used in creating the front page, and may be deleted
%%	when it is actually produced.  A few macros are left after the
%%	front page is produced, for use in (eg) page headers and
%%	footers, they are:
%%	      \FMheadtitle
%%
%% **	The abstract is treated in a strange manner, the aim being to
%%	allow multi-paragraph abstracts.  This is done with a
%%	`FMabstract' environment, it means a little more typing for
%%	the users of short abstracts, but gives the flexibility for
%%	long abstracts.
%%

% for many is to output almost nothing at all

%   Authors:
%	Use either \FMauthors{} or \FMauthor{}.  They give
%	the same effect, except that \FMauthors{} outputs the
%	line title ``Authors'' and \FMauthor{} outputs ``Author''.
%	See also the section below on Authorisation and Authors.
%   Authorisation:
%	To get an authorisation entry use \FMauthorisation{}.
%   Authorisation and Authors:
%	The  Authorisation, Author and Authors entries requires are a
%	four column LaTeX tabular environments, containing: name,
%	function, signature, and date.  (Author has location rather
%	than function).  Multiple authorisation entries can be obtained
%	by having several table rows.  Eg:
%		\FMauthorisation{name1 & func1 & sig1 & date1\\
%			name2 & func2 & sig2 & date2}
%   Distribution:
%	This is a simple text field, to get multiple
%	distributions use some sort of table, eg:
%		\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{1.1in}}l} ...
%	Or, for a distribution list with addresses etc, use
%	a table with several columns.
%
% These macros are called after the \begin{document}.
