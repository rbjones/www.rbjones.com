Driven by the need to market themselves and their products to increasingly sophisticated and demanding consumers, companies invert their priorities, identifying themselves with non-financial objectives to which financial goals are subordinate.

Science becomes concerned primarily with constructing and experimentally evaluating mathematical models of aspects of the real world, rather than with discovering "the truth".

Science is a service to engineering, providing the necessary models of physical systems for use in engineering design.

The major focus of scientific research shifts from discovering fundentally new scientific laws to organising and presenting existing scientific knowledge in better ways.
In particular, scientific laws are translated into well structured formally defined mathematical models, suitable for use by logic based artificial intelligence, both in analysing the performance of designs whose behaviour is predictable using the models and in automating an increasing proportion of the design process.

This process will involve a great deal of human intelligence during the next century contributing both to generating the variation and to the selection of "the fittest".

In utopia basic needs are easily satisfied, work is what each of us elects to contribute to the common weal.

A minority today do just what they want to do and are able to make a living from it.
In utopia this is the norm rather than the exception.
The distinction between play and work dissolves.

Not just what you do at school, but what you do whenever you come across something novel or confront a new challenge.
Life in utopia is full of this stuff.

In the past many have learnt a trade in their youth and then worked it for the rest of their lives.
In the future things change too fast, and we have to learn and develop throughout our lives.
The distinction between working and learning dissolves.

This is what makes us feel good, and what we do when, for a while we relax and put aside ambition.

Play has always been partly about relaxation and enjoyment, and partly about learning in an environment where mistakes don't matter (so much!).
We learn better while we play, and often enjoy play better if we are learning.
The distinction between learning and playing dissolves.
