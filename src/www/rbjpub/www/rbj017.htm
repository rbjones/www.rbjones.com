<H1>Factasy - "what if" for strategy formulation</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
I searched for the word "factasy" on the Web this morning (96/3/24 using <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/"><EM>Alta Vista</EM></A>)
Found one occurrence on a Web page and none in usenet.
I wrote to the owner of the Web page to discover if it was a typo, and if not, what it was intended to mean, and if there were any precedents.
<P>
Anyway the usage I propose is:
<P>
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=4>Factasy</FONT> - a genre which treads the line between fact and fantasy
</CENTER>
<P>
96/3/31

Later that day I got a response.
The page owner thought it was a typo (evidently he didn't actually write it, but it sounds like he talked to the guy who did).
<P>
So what does it take to establish a new genre?
<P>
I started to check out the newsgroups to see if I could find one where a discussion of factasy would be sensible.
I havn't really found the place yet.
<P>
I found <A HREF="news:alt.shared-reality.?">alt.shared-reality.?</A>.
