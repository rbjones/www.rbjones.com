I spent a morning bringing more of <I><A HREF="../../rbj027.htm">the Factasia Content Lattice</A></I> into line with the new look/feel/structure.
Its the embarrassment factor driving me here, the new structure makes the euchhy bits more conspicuous so I have to clean up the act.
e.g. tidied up <A HREF="../../religion/index.htm">religion</A> which was badly in need, and reworked <A HREF="../../maths/index.htm">maths</A>, which was OK but is now better.
<A HREF="../../values/index.htm">values</A> is next for the treatment.
<P>
<CENTER><B><A HREF="../../rbj033.htm">Strategy</A></B></CENTER>
I wrote a <A HREF="../../rbj033.htm">strategy</A> on Monday which already I want to completely rewrite.
I was really getting into planning large scale campaigns, but its pretty plain to me that I have to proceed by guerilla warfare.
Also I seem to be putting off the moment of truth (e.g. on the business model) by discovering lots of other things I have to do before I can start the business model.
I'm contemplating a new regime under which it is never right to do something else first.
Whatever the most important thing to do is, you start it with a cameo, right on topic.

A one page overview of <I><A HREF="../../bus/bus004.htm">the Factasia business model</A></I> is now in place.
I'll let that stew for a while and try to do a one pager for <I><A HREF="../../values/val004.htm">the Factasia Value System</A></I> and <I><A HREF="../../bus/bus003.htm">the Factasia Business Park</A></I>.
