</CENTER>
There are many kinds of intellectual property and many ways of realising its value.
Here we are concerned with one of the more difficult kinds, <I>Future Vision</I> creating by a <I>Future Engineer</I>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Free Dissemination</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A vision conceived as <I>future engineering</I> will not realise its purpose unless it helps to build consensus.
It is therefore desirable that the vision be freely desseminated, and that any financial return come by less direct means than charging the people who view the vision.

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>This is RE-USE.
The more people see, it the bigger the payback.</FONT>
<BR>

</UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Use traffic to POSITION corporations</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>i.e. to help associate a corporation with your vision, values or ideas.</FONT>
</UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Position Value X Traffic => Sponsorship Revenue</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=4>The value of sponsorship to a company is dependent on the exposure, i.e. the level of traffic which is exposed to the sponsorship information, and the nature and strength of the association which is thereby created in the minds of the viewers.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The value also depends upon the quality of the traffic, i.e. whether the people exposed are likely to be influenced by the message.
A strong and well articulated vision will draw a readership which are are sympathetic to that vision and are therefore likely to view in a positive light any corporation which associates itself with the vision.

ALSO: Vision => Sci-Fi => Film +++</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>If you can get together something which feeds into a "Jurassic Park" then this will feed back and strengthen your position even if there is no direct financial connection.
There is only one Jurassic Park, but to the extent that the vision which you are promoting can be translated into good story lines there may be a feed through into more popular media with a positive result in terms of consensus building.</FONT>
