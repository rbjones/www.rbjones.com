"The Future" is a pretty large topic (at least half of everything).
"The Future of The Future" sounds about as large.
I'm not going to cover it all so here are some first clues about which bits I'm most interested in here:
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Milky Way</FONT>
First we pick a tiny geographical region (<A HREF="c00410.htm">photo of milky way</A>).
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Planet Earth</FONT>
And next an even smaller one (<A HREF="c00411.htm">photo of planet earth</A>), which we might think of as our <A HREF="c00412.htm">Global SuperOrganism</A>.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Next 50 Years</FONT>
And then we limit the temporal scope.
Most of what I want to talk about will probably happen well within the next 50 years.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Information Industries</FONT>
I'm interested in information/knowledge engineering and its future contribution to our world.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Future Engineering</FONT>
And I'm interested in <A HREF="c00413.htm">how we can forecast</A>, influence, design and implement our future global IT systems.
Especially how each of us as individuals can contribute effectively to this process.
"Future Engineering" is the phrase I am using for the process of working out a design for a piece of the future and setting about trying to make it happen.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Global SuperBrain / The Singularity</FONT>
The future broadband network of people and computers, when considered as a cohesive global system, can be hyped up as a "<A HREF="../../cs/ai014.htm">global superbrain</A>".
This may or may not turn out to contain a <I><A HREF="http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/vinge.html">singularity</A></I> in the sense of <A HREF="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~phoenix/vinge.html">Vernor Vinge</A>.
</UL>
