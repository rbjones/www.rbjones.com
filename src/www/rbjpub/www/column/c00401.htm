A part of the larger project which is <A HREF="../../rbj008.htm">Factasia</A>, and its interest in <A HREF="c00408.htm">The Next Logical Revolution</A>.
Here we are investigating methods, so that anyone who wants to join the revolution has some idea how to go about it.

Who calls the shots in the IT industry?
A brief look at where the power has been so far.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="c00418.htm">Hierarchies - Networks - Markets</A></FONT>
Trends in organisation, of governments, businesses and engineering, dismantling heirarchies and making more use of market mechanisms, combined with rapid changes in how the markets work, are examined for their potential effects on the location of power and influence.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="c00429.htm">Future Future Makers</A></FONT>
Extrapolating on the changes we can see today we anticipate a future in which intellectual capital and those who can create it have the upper hand over financial and industrial might.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial"><A HREF="c00432.htm">Technologies for Future Engineering</A></FONT>
Taking for granted a major shift away from heirarchic and toward market solutions, we consider whether lessons from evolutionary theory can be applied to large scale non-biological engineering.

Can future engineering methods foment the next logical revolution?
