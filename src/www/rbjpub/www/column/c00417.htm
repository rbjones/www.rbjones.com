The information industries have been characterised, since the development of the first general purpose digital computers, but very rapid development in the technologies on which it is based.
The technology developments have in many cases been disruptive discontinuities which have resulted in significant shifts in both the market being served and the corporations best equipped to serve those markets.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Changing Markets</FONT><BR>
To understand the dynamics of power in the industry it is therefore necessary to look at the kinds of discontinuities which have occurred, both in technology and in marketplace, and to see how these discontinuity impact on the distribution and structure of real power in the industry.
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">Information as Mass Market</FONT><BR>
We are now entering an era in which information products are so pervasive that they encompass the whole of society and become the dominant part of the consumer economy.
In this context the powers which most effectively influence the mass of ordinary people become a more potent force in directing the information industries.
