This week the site restructuring ideas have been extended from the netlink resource pages across the rest of the site.
<P>
I now think of the site as three different areas, each with its own characteristic colour.
<TABLE CLASS=thm><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#e0d0e0">
<B>The Thematic area</B><BR>
This is what Factasia is really about.
It is purposive and thematic, multidisciplinary themes which defy taxonomy.
Also involves multiple content-sharing perspectives.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE CLASS=con><TR><TD>
<B>The Content Lattice</B><BR>
The "content lattice" is a taxonomic view of the content of Factasia, which provides a more or less arbitrary cannonical placement of all the material in Factasia.
This is partly to support physical placement of material, but mostly to give a way of navigating content which is more familiar than the relative anarchy of the thematic threads.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<TABLE CLASS=res><TR><TD>
<B>The Resource Lattice</B><BR>
This is a taxonomic resource for access to resources at other web sites which parallels the structure used in the Factasia content lattice.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</FONT></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
This programme is partly implemented, fairly well progressed in the resource pages, not much progressed elsewhere.
<P>
I have rewritten the <A HREF="../../../index.htm">front page</A> showing three corresponding routes through factasia, and also replaced the previous netlink frame with a <A HREF="../../rbj011.htm">resource frame</A> and a <A HREF="../../rbj016.htm">content frame</A>
<P>
All this is part of an increased concern with the coherence of the Factasia site, which I have never given much attention until recently, and with various kinds of transparency which I am now looking for:
<OL>
<LI>Navigational Transparancy
<LI>Structural transparency
<LI>Purposive and thematic transparency
<LI>Strategic and tactical transparency
</OL>
The idea is to make it much more obvious what Factasia is about, where it is going, and how it intends to get there.
