<CENTER><B>Back to <I>the content</I></B></CENTER>
This week I have been trying to make a transition back into <I>writing</I> after spending too long re-engineering the net links part of the site.
<P>
So I wrote a <A HREF="../../rbj027.htm">top-level content-page</A>, went on to the <A HREF="../../www/index.htm">writing page</A>, and started the <A HREF="../../www/www001.htm">Web Writer's Well</A>.
<P>
<CENTER><B>The Factasia Business Model</B></CENTER>
I also put my brain in gear for a serious new tranche of thematic content material, ready to start work on this year's mega-theme, the Factasia Business Model.
I know that sounds dreadfully boring, but my idea of what's involved in building a business model is not exactly that of the average businessman.
<P>
The business model will have to comprehend the whole of Factasia and is therefore a cross-subject theme, rather than just about business.
So it belongs in the factasia theme park, which doesn't exist yet.
So the first preliminary to getting a business model is to create the Factasia Theme Park, which I have just made a start at (<A HREF="../../rbj029.htm"><I>here</I></A>).

<P>
Researching the business model is a WWW based R&amp;D activity, and I want to put together a method for doing this and developing a WWW deployable resource concurrently.

<CENTER><B>Hassle with HTML</B></CENTER>
I downloaded <I>Preview 2</I> of <I>Netscape Navigator 4.0</I> and discovered to my dismay that it crashes on many of my pages.
In my efforts (in vain) to discover what provokes this I got the spyglass HTML validator (which is pretty good).
<P>
So now I know how bad my HTML is and I'm going to have to spend a lot of time cleaning it up.
However, cleaning up won't be enough to make my pages OK for navigator 4.0P2.
Pro-tem I've put a warning on the front page (which is not a lot of use since most people come in by one of the back doors.)
