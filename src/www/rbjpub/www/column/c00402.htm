<LI><FONT SIZE=5>Making a living from proof</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>
This was a talk I gave in 1994 at Edinburgh University about our experience in ICL in basing a small business around the hard end of formal methods, building proof tools and applying them to the formal verification of highly assured secure IT systems.
<BR>
It was my first public attempt in the face of declining opportunities in this area to seriously consider whether formal verification is the best way to exploit logic in IT or whether there are bigger opportunities.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5><A HREF="c00100.htm">From Heirarchy to Web</A></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>
This was a short presentation I gave in 1995 at ICL Winnersh in attempt to raise awareness of the importance to ICL of the World Wide Web.
At this time only a handful of people at Winnersh had Web access.
The message was about how the WWW was a catalyst accelerating business trends already apparent (downsizing etc.) that the important thing to come to terms with was new ways of working together, post command heirarchy, which would transform the nature of business.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5><A HREF="c00300.htm">Logical Revolutions, Past Present and Future</A></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>
The message from the Edinburgh talk was that we should be heading in a direction which there is little sign that anyone is going.
This material was followup research investigating the precedents for major changes in our understanding of logic and its practical applications.
This was to test the credibility of the proposition that we might in the not too far distant future end up exploiting logic in much more radical and pervasive ways than seem likely on the basis of present day trends in IT.</FONT>
