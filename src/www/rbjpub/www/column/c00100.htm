<FONT SIZE=2>
Traditionally organisations have control structures operating through
one-many superior/subordinate relationships (which also determines
employee compensation).
In some socialist states hierarchic organisation also appears in the 
"command economy".
Individual agents may not be permitted to exercise their judgment in 
meeting the needs of their customers, and their compensation may be
tenously linked with delivered value.

A free market economy has web or net-like control structures.
each node is an agent whose behaviour and economic return is 
influenced primarily by <EM>customer/supplier</EM> relationships.
These structures encourage more responsive suppliers and better
value/price coupling,

Two startling examples of how centralised command structures can fail and how decentralised free initiatives can work are the collapse of the Soviet Socialist system and the extraordinary explosion of activity on the World Wide Web.

This turns inside out our ideas about order and chaos.

A typical free market economy has been a network of corporations each
with internal hierarchic command structures.
<P>
However, this picture has been evolving:

<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
Long term trends have been reducing the place of hierarchic command structures in business.
<P>
Businesses have been shrinking by procuring more of the services they need on open markets rather than from employees.
This trend ultimately leads to the virtual corporation which has no employees.
<P>
The other trend is towards internal forms of organisation which are less hierarchic and more market-like.
These may improve an organisations ability to compete with smaller companies.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Downsizing of businesses changes the balance between hierarchy and
network by making a web with smaller but more numerous nodes.
Small hierarchies work better than large ones.
<P>
Restructuring of businesses makes the internal structure of the nodes
themselves web-like.
The economy is becoming a web of web's.

<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
Can internal markets enable corporations to operate as effectively as external open markets?
<P>
Positioning in the trade-off between security and compensation is significant, and the security embodied in monotonic pay adjustments is an inhibitor to real value pricing of internally sourced services.
<P>
To offset residual disadvantage it is important to fully realise the advantages of the organisation.
Effective knowledge sharing and common culture are important in this area.
<P>
Internal markets may fail to handle investment decisions effectively, or at all.
These decisions may lie outside to the domain of the internal market, or they may be pushed down to units too small to invest for the long term.

</UL></FONT></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
The 'information superhighway', at present approximated by WWW, will greatly assist small companies and facilitate the downsizing trend.
<P>
This will tip the balance further in favour of outsourcing of services and force the internal organisation of companies to move more rapidly to overcome their disadvantages relative to the external global marketplace.
<P>
It is not clear how the size advantage of efficient global electronic markets can be resisted.
Ultimately we may see virtually all customer/supplier relationships effected by trading over the internet.

</UL></FONT></TD>
<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
These are things to get good at:
<P>
Getting the hire/buy/contract decision right is important, and the relative merits of these will be changing rapidly.
<P>
Getting good at electronic procurement of remotely sourced products and services is important.
<P>
When deciding whether to internally or locally source you need to know the real cost differentials, which are likely to be large in many cases.
<P>
The cost differential will be larger for operators who have the necessary skills to use networks effectively, and we will all have to compete with these people.
Having contractors physically on-site will become more expensive, and substantial economic value will become attached to the ability to operate an effective globally distributed electronically interworking team.

<TD><FONT SIZE=2>
Anyone whose business is knowledge should think hard about how that knowledge is procured and delivered to the customer.
<P>
One-one delivery is extremely expensive relative to any method which permits large numbers to benefit from the knowledge.
<P>
A rigid compartmentalisation of service delivery and product development will be economically disadvantageous.
<P>
The range of knowledge based services which can be delivered by computers will be continually expanding, and this will effect what human delivered services and consultancy can be sold.
