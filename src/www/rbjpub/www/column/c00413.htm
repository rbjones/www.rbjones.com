<FONT SIZE=2>The future is influenced by the efforts which many people are engaged in to change the world.
These people have an inside track on how the future will turn out, the successful shakers and movers will be (by definition) closer to the mark.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">The pace of change is radically
increasing.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Catalysed by the profound discontinuities which come with the Information Superhighway.
This increase in the pace of change makes it more difficult to forecast even a few years ahead, and makes the economic importance of information about the future much greater.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Arial">We could use some better ways of
engineering the future.</FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>
It is therefore desirable to be able to develop more effective and systematic methods for determining and influencing the future.
If our attempts to influence the future are methodical and well-founded they amount to a kind of futuristic engineering.</FONT>

There is a lot of <A HREF="../../future/fut000.htm">futuristic material on the web</A>, maybe <A HREF="../../rbj008.htm">Factasia</A> will be the first of many <I>future engineering</I> enterprises.
