<H1>Utopian Fantasy</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
When I first put down some thoughts about <A HREF="rbj001.htm"><EM>Stream of Consciousness</EM></A> I had no idea of writing fiction.
<P>
Recently however, the idea has not seemed so absurd.
And I noticed that the stream of consciousness page was getting some hits even though it isn't overtly linked.
I know Scooter hoovered it up, and he must have been putting people onto me, they are probably all dissapointed to discover that <EM>Alta Vista</EM> has sent them on a wild goose chase.
<P>
Anyway.
While the idea of me writing anything much like a novel hasn't become much more credible, fantasy is another matter.
Fantasy I am into.
The fact that I much prefer thinking my own thoughts to reading others makes any writing of a scholary nature hard.
To be scholarly, you have to read up more than anyone else so you can give the definitive account on some topic.
<P>
Still, I am a dreamer.
I do spend all this time engaged in what I'm now tempted to recognise as <EM>fantasy</EM>, and I really would be like to be able to write like I think (that's why I was thinking about <A HREF="rbj001.htm"><EM>Stream of Consciousness</EM></A>).
And it isn't deliberately fiction, but its pretty hard to present it as fact.
<P>
So I do have this problem of genre, finding a genre in which to write seems hard.
<P>
I guess I will have to evolve a genre for myself.
Some kind of muddle between social, existential and analytic philosophy, utopian fantasy, science fiction..., maybe even a bit of satire.
Maybe <EM>speculative philosophy</EM> is the right term.
I guess it must have been used before, it would be interesting to know what for (metaphysics maybe).
<P>
I had a look in the bookshop for science fiction dealing with information technology, and came out with <EM>The Complete Robot</EM> by Asimov.
Reading this I can place myself in some middle ground.
I'm not really interested in anything that I don't think possibly true.
I don't know whether Asimov thought what he was writing plausible, but here and now I don't.
Probably they were more plausible at the time they were written, 50 years ago some of them.
Not that I don't think they are good little stories, but they are fantastic in the sense that they belong to a world other than ours, one which is not and will never be.
<P>
Thus we arrive at:
