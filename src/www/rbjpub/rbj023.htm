<FONT SIZE=2>
Factasia is about the Future.
When I'm trying to work out how to develop Factasia, you can imagine me sitting here gazing into a crystal ball reflecting on the future.
<P>
However, for reflecting on the future I decided a small hand mirror might give me a better image.

<CENTER><B>3. A Bigger Picture</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
On the wall by the side of me is another large mirror.
I swing round in my chair until, in the hand mirror, I can see the image of myself and the hand mirror reflected in the wall mirror.
<P>
I'm now reflecting on my own reflections.
The view of the future presented in Factasia, includes the future of Factasia itself.
Through the hand mirror I peer at the future of the future.

<CENTER><B>5. Worm-holes</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The image of Factasia inside Factasia is a worm-hole through cyber-space which enables Factasia to tunnel into the future.
Its not just a one off, each time I pull the future out of the worm hole I find a more distant future waiting to be grasped.

<CENTER><B>2. Looking through the Glass</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
So I'm sitting there peering into this hand mirror, which we may think of as factasia's window on the future.
First impressions are that the picture is incomplete.
<P>
I'm hoping that Factasia is going to be around for some time, but I can't see any sight of it.
The one thing that I can't see in the mirror is the mirror itself.
I'm evidently not reflecting on the right things.

<CENTER><B>4. Grasping the Future</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Now imagine me reaching through this looking glass into the future, grasping the distant hand mirror, and pulling it back from the future into the present.
<P>
I look at the future of Factasia and ask the question "what does it take to make that happen <I>now</I>?".
Reflection pulls today's Factasia into the future.
</FONT>
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<CENTER><B>6. Warp-drive</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Looking through the glass I see an infinite sequence of mirrors, each one more distant into the future.
<P>
This is Factasia's Warp Drive.
