Consensus is the Magic power which will help us to build the Factasian Utopia.
Religion is the most effective way yet found of building communities with strongly held shared values.

The religious side of Factasia is both flexible and (as in most societies) discretionary.
We expect to see even more religious diversity than there is today, and a substantial number of people who make their valuable contribution to our society while preferring to avoid or condemn religious movements.

<CENTER><B>Religious Innovation</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
We advocate religious innovation.
If you don't like the look of the religions on offer, you don't have to make do without.
Feel free to design your own.

<CENTER><B>Non-Authoritarian</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Religions are often institutionalised as heirarchies whose supreme authority is super-natural.
We seek a consensual religion which is non-authoritarian, non-heirarchic, of plainly human origin and which does not depend upon (or exclude) belief in the super-natural.

<CENTER><B>Progressive</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Religions are overwhelmingly inflexible and conservative in character.
We seek a religion sympathetic to the information age, which is not only a radical departure from the present, but also a living force helping us to build and develop our social vision into the future.

<CENTER><B>Personal Philosophy</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
A religion should help each individual to build his own personal philosophy guiding his course through life.
It should recognise the individual's personal authority in this inner sphere.

<CENTER><B>Shared Altruistic Ethic</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The essential character of a religion is determined by the fundamental ethical values which are shared by its adherents.
The most important feature of the religion we advocate is its altruistic ethic.
</FONT></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>The Social Frame</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
A key feature of <I>ethical</I> values is that we feel it necessary to press them upon others.
A religion must encompass a view of how such pressure can be brought to bear which is itself subject to and consistent with the ethical norms.

This page owes its origin to those well meaning clerics who I have sometimes heard speak on the media of their conviction that most people, even those who do not believe in God, have a spiritual dimension to their lives and are in that sense religious.
<P>
This used to get up my nose.
Were these guys trying to make out that I had some kind of subconscious belief in God?
</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE=2>
But its not so clear where lies the boundary of religion.
We happily consider <I>Zen Buddhism</I> a religion, even though that doesn't seem to involve a God.
<P>
So I decided to consider the merits of religion independently of those of belief in God.
I'm thinking about what would be for me a worthwhile religion for the future.
Rather slowly.
Its not at the top of my list.
