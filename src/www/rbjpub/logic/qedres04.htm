<CENTER><H1>The Relationship of QED to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and to Automated Reasoning (AR)</H1></CENTER>
<P>
Project QED is largely independent of the question of the possibility  
or utility of artificial intelligence or automated reasoning.  To the  
extent that mechanical aids of any kind can be used to help construct  
(or shorten) entries in the QED system, we can be appreciative of such  
aids, even if the aids use techniques that are from the realms of  
artificial intelligence, assuming of course that what the aids  
suggest doing is verifiably correct.  A key fact is that it will not  
matter, from the viewpoint of soundness, whether proofs were added to  
the QED system by humans, dumb programs, smart programs or some  
combination thereof.  All of the QED system will be checkable by a  
simple program, from first principles.  The QED system will focus on  
what is known in mathematics, both theorems and techniques, rather  
than upon the problems of discovering new mathematics.  
<P>
It is the view of some of us that many people who could have easily  
contributed to project QED have been distracted away by the enticing  
lure of AI or AR.  It can be agreed that the grand visions of AI or AR  
are much more interesting than a completed QED system while still  
believing that there is great aesthetic, philosophical, scientific,  
educational, and technological value in the construction of the QED  
system, regardless of whether its construction is or is not largely  
done `by hand' or largely automatically.
