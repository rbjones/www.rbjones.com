<H3>Sentential Connectives in Natural Languages</H3>

<TABLE CLASS=con CELLPADDING=5><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
It may be observed in the workings of natural languages that there are certain constructions which have the following features.
<DL>
<DT>They are <EM>sentential</EM> operators
<DD>They operate on one or more complete sentences to give a new sentence.
<DT>They are <EM>truth functional</EM> operators
<DD>The truth of the resulting sentence can be determined knowing only the truth values of the sentences from which it was constructed.
</DL>
An example is the construction known as <EM>conjunction</EM>.
This consists in conjoining two sentences with the connective <EM>and</EM>.
</TD><TD>
<P>
For example, the conjunction of the two sentences::
<UL>
<LI>Grass is green
<LI>Pigs don't fly.
</UL>

Is the sentence:

<UL><LI>Grass is green and pigs don't fly.</UL>
<P>
The conjunction of two sentence will be true if, and only if, each of the two sentences from which it was formed is true.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
<TABLE CLASS=con CELLPADDING=5><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>

Other propositional connectives include:
<DL>
<DT>p or q
<DD>known as the <EM>disjunction</EM> of "p" and "q".
<DT>not p
<DD>known as the <EM>negation</EM> of "p".
</DL>
For the complete range see: <A HREF="log048.htm">Boolean Operators</A>.

<TABLE CLASS=con CELLPADDING=5><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
In natural languages, words whose primary role is truth functional often have other roles as well.
This is one of many ways in which natural languages fail to be ideal for some logical or technical purposes.
To overcome these difficulties formal languages may be helpful.
Where a logic is concerned only with sentential connectives it is usually called a <EM>propositional</EM> logic.
</TD><TD>
The most well known, and probably the simplest of these logics is known as <EM>classical</EM> or <EM>boolean</EM> propositional logic, in which it is assumed that all propositions have a definite truth value; a proposition is either <EM>true</EM> or it is <EM>false</EM>.
