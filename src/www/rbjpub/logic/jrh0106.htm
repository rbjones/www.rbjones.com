Thus far, formalized mathematics seems an unpromising idea. Bourbaki may be
right that such formalization is simply impractical for people to do. In any
case, as <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#naur-pvf"><EM>[naur-pvf]</EM></A> points out, formalization sometimes leads to <EM>
more</EM> errors, not fewer, as the underlying intuition which provides a check on
correctness begins to get lost --- so even one of the claimed merits of
formalization is open to question. The problems of formalization have been well
put by <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#constable-programs"><EM>[constable-programs]</EM></A>:

It is thus possible to translate the proof of any mathematical theorem into a
completely formal proof. However, the prospect of actually doing this is quite
daunting because an informal proof of modest length will expand to a formal one
of prodigious size and will require in its production extreme care and detailed
knowledge of the more or less arbitrary conventions of the particular
formalism. These tedious details will in sheer number dominate the interesting
mathematical ideas which are the <EM> raison d'&#234;tre</EM> of the proof.

But like the authors just quoted, we believe that the arrival of the computer
changes the situation completely, for several reasons.

<LI> As pointed out by Naur and others like <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#vangasteren-shape"><EM>[vangasteren-shape]</EM></A>, as one
relies less on intuition and more on rules of formal manipulation, accuracy in
those manipulations becomes more important. This is tedious for
people,<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> but checking conformance to formal rules is one of the
things computers are very good at. Indeed, the Bourbaki claim that the
transition to a completely formal text is routine, but too boring and tedious
for people, seems almost an open invitation to give the task to computers.

<LI> The computer need not simply check the correctness of formal arguments,
but can try to help in their construction. We will discuss in more detail later
how this is to be done, but at one extreme, it is sometimes possible for
computers to find proofs of theorems completely automatically. Furthermore, the
computer can provide interface assistance, helping to mitigate the austerity of
formal deductive calculi and to organize the user's work.

<LI> Among modern computer scientists, formal logic is quite widely known and
substantially used; many regard formal logic as the 'applied mathematics'
underlying computer science, just as real analysis etc. underlies physics and
engineering. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#dijkstra-invariance"><EM>[dijkstra-invariance]</EM></A> has remarked that 'computing
scientists may well have been the first to <EM> use</EM> the predicate calculus
regularly [...] as far as the mathematical community is concerned George
Boole has lived in vain'.
<P>
<A NAME="par70"></A>
<LI> Computer correctness is itself a topic of concern, especially since
computers are used in safety-critical systems like fly-by-wire aircraft,
antilock braking systems, nuclear reactor controllers and radiation therapy
machines. One means of verifying a design is to prove that a mathematical model
of the system satisfies some formal properties, designed to correspond to
real-world requirements. Such proofs are much more technically intricate,
albeit perhaps shallower, than typical mathematics proofs, and of necessity
involve very complicated formal manipulations.

It isn't very surprising that the computer should make such a dramatic
difference; after all it has revolutionized work in many scientific
disciplines. Previously unthinkable ideas like detailed simulations of weather
systems have become possible --- formalizing mathematics in a deductive
calculus demands fairly modest computer power by comparison.

So thanks to the computer, we may at last be able to do something about the
lack of formality in ordinary mathematics. This would be welcome to 'hawkish'
logicians<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> like
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#nidditch"><EM>[nidditch]</EM></A>, who complained that 'in the whole literature of mathematics
there is not a single valid proof in the logical sense', but perhaps not to
people such as <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#demillo-social"><EM>[demillo-social]</EM></A> who regard the conventional 'social
mechanisms of the mathematical community' as the only real means of
establishing a valid proof. We do not agree with either of these extreme
positions. Regarding the latter, we think that social processes may just be a
necessary evil resulting from the difficulty (hitherto) of producing formal
proofs.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> Compare the
enthusiasm among the Greeks for deciding scientific questions by a social
process rather than empirically, a tendency that survived until about
Descartes.
