A formal system is a collection of sentences in some formal language together with a method of constructing
 demonstrations of some subset of the sentences.
Demonstrable sentences are called theorems of the system and are normally intended to be some or
all of the sentences which are <EM>true</EM> relative to some intended semantics for the sentences.
<BR>
Some, but not all of these systems are normally described as <EM>logic</EM>s, others may be called
calculi.
The distinction is, however, rather loose and sometimes inconsistent
(consider the <A HREF="cl/cl007.htm">lambda calculus</A> and <A HREF="cl/cl006.htm">pure combinatory logic</A>).
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Logics</FONT></B> - 
Those formal systems normally described as <A HREF="log001.htm">logic</A>s fall into two main groups.
Firstly there are simple systems such as <A HREF="log003.htm">propositional</A> and modal logics, which, though limited in their
expressiveness, are clearly concerned with reasoning rather than computation.
Secondly there are the <A HREF="log019.htm">predicate logic</A>s, which are distinguished from calculi by containing constructs (such as quantifiers) which may not be computable, and therefore have the potential to demonstrate claims which cannot be established by brute computation.
(e.g. that some algorithm does not terminate, or, Fermat's last theorem.).
<BR>
Since large parts of mathematics involve such claims, a logic proper, rather than a mere calculus, is needed
for the formalisation of mathematics.
Logics fall into three groups, free logics, foundation systems, and intermediate systems.
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Free Logics</FONT></B> - 
A free logic embodies no presuppostions about what exists in the domain of discourse
(the subject matter of sentences in the logic).
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Foundation Systems</FONT></B> - 
<A HREF="../philos/maths/faq005.htm">Foundation Systems</A> embody sufficiently lavish ontological presuppositions that a mathematician using them is unlikely to
find further ontological premises necessary.
A foundation system therefore provides a framework within which issues of consistency may be resolved by formal means.
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Calculi</FONT></B> - 
The term calculus is used mainly for systems where the notation involved is essentially equivalent to
a programming language, and the sentences demonstrated are typically equations asserting the claim
that two expressions evaluate to the same value.
