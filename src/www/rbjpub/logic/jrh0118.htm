We have seen that automation is <EM> possible</EM> even while producing an explicit
proof, but how much do we actually want? Despite some <EM> tours de force</EM> by
automated theorem provers, the emphasis in applications is moving increasingly
towards interactive systems, where the user guides the prover. In mathematics
this seems reasonable, since the proofs are important, and we don't usually
want an <EM> ex cathedra</EM> assertion that something is true from a machine. On
the other hand, we also don't want to have to direct proofs at very low levels,
so some automation of 'obvious' steps is required.
<P>

As pointed out by John McCarthy, there is an important distinction between what
is <EM> mathematically</EM> obvious and what is <EM> logically</EM> obvious. In
mathematical proofs we want to skip over levels of reasoning which we can
intuitively see to be trifling; but this intuition may be based on quite
sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, and the step may not be at all obvious
in the sense of having a formal proof which is easy to find using one of the
common techniques for automated proof search (whether by machine or by hand).
An interesting discussion of just what is logically obvious is given by
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#rudnicki-obvious"><EM>[rudnicki-obvious]</EM></A>. It seems that we need more work on automating what is
mathematically obvious, whereas existing technology is already capable of
automating much larger logical steps than we can perceive as obvious, e.g. very
large tautologies or even subtle predicate calculus reasoning like the
following theorem due to \los:

However, there are certain steps which are completely routine for a machine to
check, and baffling to a human being, that we probably <EM> do</EM> want to
automate, simply because carrying out the proof in detail is no more
illuminating to the human than knowing, based on confidence in the correctness
of the theorem prover, that it is valid. A good example is the following
identity:
<P>
<A NAME="par199"></A>
   (x<SUP>2</SUP> + y<SUP>2</SUP> + z<SUP>2</SUP> + w<SUP>2</SUP>) (x'<SUP>2</SUP> + y'<SUP>2</SUP> + z'<SUP>2</SUP> + w'<SUP>2</SUP>) =    <BR>
         (x x' + y y' + z z' + w w')<SUP>2</SUP> +                       <BR>
           (x y' - y x' + w z' - z w')<SUP>2</SUP> +                      <BR>
           (x z' - z x' + y w' - w y')<SUP>2</SUP> +                      <BR>
           (x w' - w x' + z y' - y z')<SUP>2</SUP>

It's used as a lemma in the proof that every natural number is expressible as
the sum of four squares. But proving it, at least simply by multiplying it out
in a routine way, is no more illuminating than checking the result of a
numerical calculation by hand. Of course a proof that exhibited a deep, simple
reason for the above (e.g. something based on quaternions) is a different
matter.
<P>

In any case, automating what is mathematically obvious is itself a research
project in the artificial intelligence line. In the short term, it's probably
better to accept a lower level of automation. As theorem-proving technology
improves, it should be possible to simplify proofs automatically by excising
intermediate steps which become unnecessary for the machine.
