<H1>ZFC in HOL</H1>
The axiomatisation of ZFC in HOL can be undertaken in a simple and direct way.
<P>
Its nice to be able to use the proper mathematical characters in such a development.
In the original work this was done using an extension to the Cambridge HOL system, consisting of filters before and after which mapped non-ascii characters on to sequences of ascii characters in HOL.
<P>
A similar approach to supporting an extended character set was later used in ProofPower, and I have now replicated <A HREF="inter007.htm">the axiomatisation of ZFC in HOL under ProofPower</A>.
<P>
The axiomatisation of ZFC in HOL followed closely that presented in <EM>Hatcher</EM>.
This was intended to make the axiomatisation as uncontroversial as possible, and reduce the scope for errors arising the axiomatisation.
A neater axiomatisation is most probably achievable but this would have none other that aesthetic advantages over the one adopted.
<P>
