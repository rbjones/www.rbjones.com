The book series in the name of Nicolas Bourbaki (a pen-name for a group of
French mathematicians) 'takes up mathematics from the beginning, and gives
complete proofs'. This beginning <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#bourbaki-sets"><EM>[bourbaki-sets]</EM></A> is something like Zermelo
set theory<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> axiomatized in a system of first order logic,
which includes an indefinite descriptor <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/tau.gif" ALT="tau"> building in the Axiom of
(Global) Choice.

For whereas in the past it was thought that every branch of mathematics
depended on its own particular intuitions which provided its concepts and
prime truths, nowadays it is known to be possible, logically speaking, to
derive practically the whole of known mathematics from a single source, the
Theory of Sets.

On these foundations, I state that I can build up the whole of mathematics of
the present day; and if there is anything original in my procedure, it lies
solely in the fact that, instead of being content with such a statement, I
proceed to prove it in the same way as Diogenes proved the existence of motion;
and my proof will become more and more complete as my treatise grows.

The Bourbaki development is intellectually elegant, if rather austere. Stress
is placed on developing properties of various key mathematical structures like
topological spaces and groups. Some structures are instances of several others
(e.g. topological groups are both topological spaces and groups), or are
derived from others using certain canonical techniques such as completion. The
relative sophistication of these techniques means that the set theory is used
heavily even in the study of abstract structures; moreover, set theory is often
necessary to provide existence proofs for many of them. So although Hilbert's
axiomatic method was an important inspiration, deduction from the structure
axioms uses much more than pure (first order) logic. Really, one is working all
the time in axiomatic set theory. In the IMPS terminology <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#farmer-imps"><EM>[farmer-imps]</EM></A>
the Bourbaki system is a 'big theory' rather than a mosaic of 'little
theories'. A typical example of how concrete structures arise from
consideration of abstract ones is the development of real numbers given by
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#bourbaki-topology1"><EM>[bourbaki-topology1]</EM></A>. The reals are constructed as the completion of the
uniform space (this structure is a Bourbaki innovation) induced by the
topological group of rationals.

The stated purpose of the Bourbaki treatise is 'to provide a solid foundation
for the whole body of modern mathematics'. He works, notionally anyway, with a
fixed formal system axiomatizing set theory. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#mathias-bourbaki"><EM>[mathias-bourbaki]</EM></A> expresses
surprise and dismay that G&ouml;del's theorems on the essential incompleteness of
such systems seem not to perturb the Bourbachistes. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#kreisel-sad"><EM>[kreisel-sad]</EM></A>

The failure of Hilbert's programme shows that formalism does not provide a
theory of the actual process of mathematical reasoning; <EM> it is not</EM>, so to
speak, <EM> a fundamental theory</EM>. (Of course, formalization is useful, either
in limited areas or in combination with other considerations.)

But even G&ouml;del's undecidable sentence for a simple number theory is really
just a theoretical pathology. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#paris-harrington"><EM>[paris-harrington]</EM></A> have come a bit closer
to a realistic mathematical statement that cannot be proved in a simple first
order arithmetic; even this relies on a rather artificial encoding of a
combinatorial result in number theory. It seems we are nowhere near finding a
mathematically interesting incompleteness in ZFC set theory, by which we mean a
statement unprovable in ZFC but known for other reasons to be true, as distinct
from statements like the Continuum Hypothesis which have no more been decided
by non-formalistic methods. Certainly, it's hard to imagine a mainstream
mathematical result which could not be proved in ZFC set theory; the Bourbaki
project has developed extensive parts of mathematics and failed so far to find
any. So from a <EM> practical</EM> point of view, a disdainful attitude to the
significance of G&ouml;del's results seems justified.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> As remarked by

It is remarkable that in the whole of existing mathematics only very few easily
classifiable and constantly recurring forms of inference are used, so that an
extension of these methods may be desirable in theory, but is insignificant in
practice.

Although Bourbaki introduces a formal logical system in considerable detail, it
is soon forgotten about for reasons of readability and practicality:

<A NAME="par58"></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If formalized mathematics were as simple as the game of chess, then once our
chosen formalized language had been described there would remain only the task
of writing out our proofs in this language, [...] But the matter is far from
being as simple as that, and no great experience is necessary to perceive that
such a project is absolutely unrealizable: the tiniest proof at the beginning
of the Theory of Sets would already require several hundreds of signs for its
complete formalization. [...] formalized mathematics cannot in practice be
written down in full, [...] We shall therefore very quickly abandon
formalized mathematics, [...]

Nevertheless, translatability <EM> in principle</EM> into the formal set theory is
taken as the final arbiter of correctness. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#bourbaki-sets"><EM>[bourbaki-sets]</EM></A> clearly
says that 'the correctness of a mathematical text is verified by comparing it,
more or less explicitly, with the rules of a formalized language'. The
intention is that the whole Bourbaki series uses only layers of convention and
abbreviation, and could in principle be written out completely formally. This
view of formalizability as the criterion of correctness now seems to be
widespread in the mathematical community. For example, <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#maclane-mff"><EM>[maclane-mff]</EM></A> says
almost the same thing (p. 377):

As to precision, we have now stated an absolute standard of rigor: A
Mathematical proof is rigorous when it is (or could be) written out in the
first-order predicate language L(<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/memberof.gif" ALT=memberof BORDER=0>) as a sequence of inferences from the
axioms ZFC, each inference made according to one of the stated rules. [...]
When a proof is in doubt, its repair is usually just a partial approximation to
the fully formal version.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<A NAME="par61"></A>
That such a view is widespread really does seem to ignore G&ouml;del's theorem.
Simple reasoning shows that the G&ouml;del sentence for ZFC set theory is not
provable in ZFC, but, if we accept the consistency of ZFC (and surely if it is
our criterion for rigour we must), it is true. Are we to dismiss this argument
for the truth of the sentence as non-rigorous? In fact <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#lakatos-proof"><EM>[lakatos-proof]</EM></A>
identifies this, and other examples like the duality principle of projective
geometry, as <EM> post-formal</EM> proofs, reached by analysis of a formal system
rather than derived inside it. (Though of course the reasoning could in its
turn be written out in another formal system.) But once again, we accept that
G&ouml;del's theorem isn't likely to be relevant to any mathematical proofs we are
interested in, and from a strictly practical point of view, this objective
standard of rigour is a good one. Rather than discuss that, we want to focus on
the following question: why do we only accept formalizability in principle, not
formalization in practice?
