But there was still considerable interest in logical systems <EM> as themselves
objects of study</EM>. The crisis over the introduction of infinitistic methods
into mathematics, which we have already mentioned, was still rumbling on, and
Brouwer even rejected the general use of the law of the excluded middle (P <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/or.gif" ALT=or BORDER=0>
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> P). Now on previous occasions, when mathematicians wished to provide a
foundation for some new technique, they did it by an interpretation in terms of
known mathematics. The classic example is the interpretation of complex numbers
as pairs of real numbers. But for justifying infinite sets, there seemed to be
no such way out: how can one find an interpretation for infinite sets in terms
of finite ones? Hilbert's ingenious idea was to get round this by studying not
the <EM> objects</EM>, but the mathematical <EM> proofs</EM>, which are always finite,
even when they are about infinite sets.

Specifically, Hilbert proposed the following programme.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Formal systems for various mathematical
theories should be developed; thanks to the line of work culminating in
Russell's logic, combined with Hilbert's own flair for axiomatization, this was
straightforward. Then these should be proved <EM> consistent</EM>, i.e. that it is
not possible to deduce both a theorem and its negation; in symbols <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> P
and <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> P. Now given this, any 'concrete' theorem of the form <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/forall.gif" ALT=forall BORDER=0>n
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/memberof.gif" ALT=memberof BORDER=0> <B>N</B><FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT> P[n] that is deducible in the system must be true. Otherwise
there'd be some k <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/memberof.gif" ALT=memberof BORDER=0> <B>N</B> such that <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> P[k], so any reasonable logical
system will certainly be capable of proving <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> P[k] (we assume that
P[k] is simply a matter of calculation for each specific k, in particular
not itself involving unbounded quantifiers). But since <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/forall.gif" ALT=forall BORDER=0>n <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/memberof.gif" ALT=memberof BORDER=0> <B>N</B><FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT>
P[n], we also have <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> P[k], which is impossible because the system was
assumed consistent. This reasoning extends to arbitrary numbers of universal
quantifiers; a good example of such an assertion is Fermat's Last Theorem:
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/forall.gif" ALT=forall BORDER=0>x, y, z, n <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/memberof.gif" ALT=memberof BORDER=0> <B>N</B><FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT> n &gt; 2 <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/and.gif" ALT=and> x<SUP>n</SUP> + y<SUP>n</SUP> = z<SUP>n</SUP> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/implies.gif" ALT=implies BORDER=0> x = 0 <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/or.gif" ALT=or BORDER=0> y = 0.

For Hilbert, therefore, the business of proving consistency of formal theories
was central. An interesting subsidiary question was the <EM>
Entscheidungsproblem</EM> (decision problem): is it possible to decide questions in
these formal mathematical theories purely mechanically?<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Hilbert and his assistants, as well as numerous other
mathematicians and logicians, attacked these problems. Before long, there were
negative conclusions.
<P>
<A NAME="par43"></A>
First <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#godel-undecidable"><EM>[godel-undecidable]</EM></A> proved his famous First Incompleteness Theorem,
which says more or less that no given (consistent) formal system can ever
encompass even all the truths of elementary number theory: there will always be
true statements that cannot be proved in the system.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> G&ouml;del's method was roughly as follows. It's easy to see that
each sentence <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> of the formal language can be allocated a unique 'G&ouml;del
number' <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqtel.gif" ALT=qqtel><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqter.gif" ALT=qqter>, and likewise each proof --- there are after all only
countably many of each, and they have a quite simple structure. Moreover, for
any sensible encoding, the question of whether p is (the numerical coding of)
a proof of <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> can be encoded as a representable predicate<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> Prov(p,<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqtel.gif" ALT=qqtel><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqter.gif" ALT=qqter>), with the basic property
that if <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> then also <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/exists.gif" ALT=exists BORDER=0>p<FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT> Prov(p,<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqtel.gif" ALT=qqtel><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqter.gif" ALT=qqter>). Now using
a diagonalization argument, G&ouml;del was able to exhibit a statement <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> that
(intuitively) asserts its own unprovability in the system:
<P>
<A NAME="par44"></A>
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/equiv.gif" ALT=iff BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/exists.gif" ALT=exists BORDER=0>p<FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT> Prov(p,<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqtel.gif" ALT=qqtel><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqter.gif" ALT=qqter>)
<P>
<A NAME="par45"></A>
Now if the formal system is consistent, <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi">, for if <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi">
we have <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/exists.gif" ALT=exists BORDER=0>p<FONT SIZE=5>.</FONT> Prov(p,<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqtel.gif" ALT=qqtel><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/qqter.gif" ALT=qqter>) and hence <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi">.
However <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> is certainly <EM> true</EM> because it states precisely that
unprovability! On the additional assumption that the system is <EM>
1-consistent</EM>, i.e. all provable existential statements are true, then also
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/turnstil.gif" ALT="|-" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi">. But note that since <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> isn't provable, adding <IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/not.gif" ALT=not>
<IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/phi.gif" ALT="phi"> as a new axiom retains consistency, so a formal system can be consistent
yet <EM> not</EM> 1-consistent; thus the argument above that consistency implies
the truth of provable <EM> universal</EM> formulas cannot be sharpened. Now neither
of these conclusions is fatal to Hilbert's programme:<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> he never identified
mathematics with reasoning in a particular formal system, and apparently
influenced by Brouwer's critique, was prepared to dismiss existential theorems
without a construction as strictly meaningless anyway.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> But soon after came G&ouml;del's
Second Incompleteness Theorem, which states roughly that any realistic
mathematical theory, even elementary number theory, is unable to prove its own
consistency. So any consistency proof of a formal system requires <EM> greater</EM>
mathematical resources than are available in the system, and so it certainly
isn't possible to justify infinite sets finitistically. Despite the apparent
promise of Hilbert's ingenious idea of using proofs, it turns out to be just as
circular as using interpretations --- it's as if there's some mysterious
conservation principle at work like that forbidding perpetual motion! Moreover
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#church-number"><EM>[church-number]</EM></A> and <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#turing"><EM>[turing]</EM></A> showed the <EM> Entscheidungsproblem</EM>
to be unsolvable even for pure first order logic, Turing by introducing his
famous machines and so giving the first really convincing definition of a
'formal system'. Finally <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#tarski-truth"><EM>[tarski-truth]</EM></A> showed that arithmetical truth is
not even arithmetically definable, let alone recursively enumerable.

Despite the apparent failure of Hilbert's programme, the general interest in
metalogical studies has yielded many benefits and thrown new light on parts of
mathematics. (Though destructive to Hilbert's programme, some of the negative
results mentioned above have a profound mathematical and philosophical
significance.) First order logic seems particularly interesting from a
metalogical point of view: it's strong enough to express some nontrivial
mathematics, yet weak enough to allow interesting metatheorems (e.g. on the
existence on nonstandard models of the first order theory of reals). There turn
out to be some interesting first order mathematical theories that <EM> are</EM>
decidable, and this often generalizes previous results. For example, the
quantifier elimination procedure for real closed fields given by
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#tarski-decision"><EM>[tarski-decision]</EM></A> is a natural generalization of well-known results on
polynomial elimination such as Sturm's theorem.
