<H1>About this edition</H1>
</CENTER>
This edition of the QED manifesto just fell out while I was (am?) trying to position myself in relation to QED.
The content was, when first published, the same as the MAY95 version of the manifesto, but I have added additional 
material on request by father figure Bob Boyer, together with a <A HREF="qedres16.htm">change history</A>
(What's New?) to lead people straight to the new material.
<P>
The presentation benefits from the following "features":
<UL>
<LI>all the references connect (images too), some minor misformatting corrected
<LI>the manifesto is split into multiple HTML files
<LI>there are more hyperlinks to make it easier to navigate
<LI>and more anchors which make it possible to refer from elsewhere to specific parts of the manifesto
<LI>but, probably, more use of features not supported by all browsers (looks OK with
<A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape Navigator 2.0</A>)
</UL>
