This preliminary discussion of project QED (very tentative  
name) is an amalgam of many ideas that many people have had and for  
which perhaps no one alive today deserves much credit.  We are  
deliberately avoiding any authorship or institutional affiliation at  
this early stage in the project (and may decide to do so forever) in  
the hope that many will want to join in the project as principals,  
even as originators (to the extent that anyone alive today could be  
thought to be an originator of this project).  Some of those involved  
in the project would much rather that QED be completed than that they,  
as individuals, be lucky enough to partake significantly in the  
project, much less get any public credit for its completion.  It may  
seem paranoid to avoid personalities, but we are inspired by the  
extraordinary cooperation achieved in the Bourbaki series in an  
atmosphere of anonymity.
