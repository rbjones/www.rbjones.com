There are all sorts of arguments used in technical disciplines to establish the
truth of assertions. Sometimes people become convinced of the truth of
arithmetical conjectures on the basis of numerical evidence. But these methods
can lead to errors, and since at least the time of the Greeks it has been
generally accepted that a true mathematical proof must be <EM> deductive</EM>. That
is, it must proceed from accepted, or at least explicitly stated, assumptions
via a series of small incontrovertibly correct steps. Sometimes these steps
themselves may be based on spatial or even mechanical intuition ---
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#upsenskii-mechanics"><EM>[upsenskii-mechanics]</EM></A> gives some examples of the latter. But such
intuition too has fallen into disrepute in recent times, following the
discovery of such pathologies as Peano's space-filling curve and Bolzano's and
Weierstrass's everywhere continuous nowhere differentiable functions.

Now it doesn't seem fair to dismiss all geometric reasoning as non-rigorous.
Since the time of Descartes it has been known how to reduce geometry to
arithmetic (understood in a wide sense); sometimes this makes things easier,
but at times it can obscure the immediacy and simplicity of geometric
arguments. <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#arnold-newtonhooke"><EM>[arnold-newtonhooke]</EM></A> detects a vivid contrast already between
the inventors of calculus: Newton's reasoning was strongly geometric whereas
Leibniz stressed algebraic manipulation. More recently, Minkowski has shown how
quite elementary geometrical reasoning can lead to deep and important results
in number theory. Nevertheless, geometric reasoning nowadays tends to be seen
as a convenient and illuminating shorthand for a purely symbolic
proof,<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> as

A heavy warning used to be given that pictures are not rigorous; this has never
had its bluff called and has permanently frightened its victims into playing
for safety. Some pictures, of course, are not rigorous, but I should say most
are (and I use them whenever possible myself). [...] pictorial <EM>
arguments</EM>, while not so purely conventional, can be quite legitimate [...]
in the sense that in translating into symbols no step occurs that is not both
unequivocal and trivial.

But geometry is just one particularly important example of how everyday
intuitions can lead us astray. There is always a danger of being misled by the
superficial similarity of an abstract structure to some particular concrete
one; for example one might accidentally assume that multiplication in a ring
must be commutative. Sometimes the results can be serendipitous, e.g. the use
of complex numbers and Euler's successful manipulations of infinite series. But
they can also lead to serious errors, e.g. the purported proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem based on the assumption of unique factorization in arbitrary algebraic
number fields.

The pathologies of real analysis and the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries,
among other innovations, stimulated a general determination among
mathematicians to bring out unstated assumptions and either justify them or
avoid them. Even the Euclidean canon was not immune from criticism: indeed long
before Gauss had pointed out that the notion of 'betweenness' is often used in
Euclid, but never defined. This in turn led to the rise of the modern
refinement of the axiomatic method, where a set of axioms is established and
all conclusions must proceed from them by steps that are <EM> purely logical</EM>
and make no additional mathematical assumptions. Apart from the question of
reliability, this turns out to be very useful, since the same set of axioms
often admits various different realizations (a point made before, e.g. by
Boole). Consequently the same reasoning can be applied in different situations,
giving benefits of elegance and economy. One of the early classics of the
axiomatic method was a treatise on geometry by <A HREF="jrh01b.htm#hilbert-fgeom"><EM>[hilbert-fgeom]</EM></A>, which
made all assumptions explicit and analyzed the interdependence of the axioms in
detail. Reputedly he once stated that it should be possible to replace the
words 'point', 'line' and 'plane' by 'table', 'chair' and 'beer-mug' without
invalidating any of the theorems of geometry.

Also present in the <EM> Zeitgeist</EM> at about the turn of the century was a
foundationalist tendency. Not satisfied merely with uncovering the hidden
assumptions in mathematics, many tried to justify them on the basis of less
dubitable principles. Various mathematicians showed how the reals could be
understood as certain infinite sets of natural numbers, and
<A HREF="jrh01b.htm#dedekind-was"><EM>[dedekind-was]</EM></A> showed how all the properties of natural numbers could be
deduced from a very small set of axioms. He also showed how the natural numbers
could be constructed directly in pure set theory, given an infinite set; Frege
proposed another definition which he claimed was based on logic alone.

But Cantor's set theory marked a bold introduction of the actual infinite into
mathematics. This had long been viewed with scepticism, Gauss's interdiction
being well-known. Cantor distinguished carefully between 'consistent' and
'inconsistent' multiplicities, but many who used superficially similar methods
of reasoning started to encounter worrying paradoxes. Some of these paradoxes,
notably Russell's ('the set of all sets that are not members of themselves'),
involved only very simple concepts like membership and predication.
Foundational studies were plunged into a new crisis, even the most trivial
intuitive ideas seeming to cause major problems.

In this atmosphere, it's not surprising that the complete formalization of
mathematical proof should be attempted; in any case, it can be seen as the
natural next step in the evolution of ever greater precision and rigour in
mathematics. If basic concepts like 'set' and 'member' are problematical, how
can natural language and intuitive proof ever be trusted? Moreover Zermelo, who
independently discovered Russell's paradox at about the same time, had now
isolated a few set construction principles that seemed enough for all the
applications of set theory in mathematics, and apparently did not lead to
contradiction. But Zermelo's <EM> Aussonderungsaxiome</EM><A HREF="jrh01f.htm#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> relied on the notion of a '<EM>
definit</EM>' property, and attempts by others to make this precise inevitably
focused on restricting the <EM> language</EM> in which that property was stated.

Whatever the level of formalization of a deductive proof, it may be rather
unenlightening to read. In cases where the deductive proof is arrived at via
geometric intuition, that intuition is valuable for understanding the proof. In
general, the whole process by which the theorem and its proof were discovered
may be of paramount importance to grasp the theorem, the proof and their
significance (e.g. applicability to physical science or relation to other parts
of mathematics). It's well-known that one doesn't 'understand' a proof merely
by having checked the correctness of each inference it contains. Some
mathematicians prefer the intellectual purity of the deductive part, probably
following the examples of such worthies as Newton and Gauss (the latter
famously referred to other considerations as the scaffolding used to construct
a beautiful building, which should be taken down when the building is
finished). But generally, especially in introductory textbooks, there is a lot
of additional discussion. A. Trybulec distinguishes the 'formal stratum' and
the 'informal stratum', which are present in different proportions depending on
the style of the author and the intended audience. A similar combination often
occurs in formal specifications of computer systems, and advocates of 'literate
programming' accompany program texts with an interwoven explanatory discussion.
