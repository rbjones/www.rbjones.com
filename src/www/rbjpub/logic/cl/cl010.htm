<P>
There are two main historical reasons for the introduction of types.
<P>
The first type system was that devised by Russell for use in <A HREF="../../philos/bibliog/r.htm#russell62"><EM>Principia Mathematica</EM></A>,
and published in a paper entitled <A HREF="../../philos/bibliog/r.htm#russell08"><EM>Mathematical Logic as based on 
the Theory of Types</EM></A>.
Russell's motivation in introducing this theory was to overcome the problems causing inconsistency in Frege's previous
attempt to reduce mathematics to logic, in a way which was both technically and philosophically satisfactory.
<P>
The motivation for introducing types into the systems of the Lambda-SKI cube is similar.
The introduction of type constraints <EM>reduces</EM> the expressiveness of the systems sufficiently to make it possible
to introduce quantifiers without rendering the systems inconsistent.
In particular, the introduction of a type system constrains the domains over which functions may be defined in a manner
similar to the constraints which are necessary in set theory for the theory to be consistent with the semantics of the
iterative heirarchy of sets.
<P>
We will consider in the systems around the Lambda-SKI cube the very simple type system introduced by Church for his
<A HREF="../../philos/bibliog/c.htm#Church40"><EM>Simple Theory of Types</EM></A>, together with some small elaborations of that system which have proven desirable in practical
implementations and which were introduced in LCF and inherited by
<A HREF="http://hol.sourceforge.net/">HOL</A>.
