       Since the publication of Goedel's incompleteness results it
         has been accepted that formal systems are often incomplete with
         respect to their intended subject matter, particularly arithmetic.

         What this means is that we have some intended semantics for the
         formal notation, and that we can establish that some statements in
         this notation which are true relative to the intended
         interpretation are not provable in the formal system.  What Godel
         showed in relation to arithmetic was that the formal systems are
         essentially incomplete, that there is no way of patching up the
         formal systems so as to remedy their deficiencies.

         It is sometimes also true that the underlying semantic ideas are
         also essentially incomplete.  A case in point here is classical
         set theory, based upon the iterative conception of sets.  In this
         view of set theory a universe of sets is created subject only to
         the constraint that these sets are conceived of as being created
         in some order, such that no set is created until all of its
         members have been created.  The process of constructing the
         universe proceeds in stages, starting with an empty universe.  At
         each stage a number of new sets are created whose members are all
         sets which have been formed at previous stages, and all sets which
         have not previously been formed but can be formed under this
         constraint will be formed.  This process is undertaken by
         transfinite iteration, aggregating by taking a union the effects
         of any infinite sequence of steps.  It is understood that this
         process can never be completed, though a model adequate for any
         finitary axiomatisation of set theory can always be obtained
         eventually after a number of stages which depends upon the proof
         theoretic strength of the formal system.                                                                                                                     
<P>
         Any particular axiomatisation of classical set theory (or at least
         any which is intended to address this standard iterative
         conception) will be sound with respect to the universes formed at
         any stage subsequent to the first which provides an adequate model
         for that theory, and may therefore be thought of informally as
         being an incomplete formalisation of some ideal universe which
         represents the completion of this iterative process.  However it
         is clear that this process cannot be completed.  This is the case
         by definition, since the whole conception is based on the view
         that after any completed phase in this process we can aggregate
         all the sets so far produced and form a new set with these sets as
         members.
<P>
         We do not suggest here that it is the incompletability of the
         iterative universe that is responsible for the incompleteness in
         the formal system, this is not the case, we simply point out the
         incompleteness of the semantic model so that the formal systems
         which we consider in this paper may be understood not to be so
         exceptional simply because the models with which we support our
         claim that the systems are consistent are essentially incomplete
         relative to the intuitive semantics of the notations.
<P>
         In the field of combinatory logic the kind of incompleteness
         present in the iterative conception of set may be felt to be
         problematic.  This incompleteness does have impact on the formal
         systems based on these models.  It causes restrictions on the
         principle of abstraction, which prevent arbitrary abstractions to
         be considered as determining sets, and this is a significant
         inconvenience in some important applications of these theories.
<P>
