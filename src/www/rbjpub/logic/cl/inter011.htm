<H1>Strong Consistent Combinatory Logics</H1>
 <P>
         Since the discovery of inconsistency in Frege's logical
         foundations for mathematics, no generally acceptable foundation
         systems have been put forward which admit as Frege's did an
         unconstrained principle of set comprehension.
<P>
         One line of research which has sought to recover this facility,
         albeit in the more general context of unrestricted functional
         abstraction, has been research in combinatory logic.  In these
         studies a more exacting requirement has also been sought, that the
         logical operators are themselves values in the domain of discourse
         and range of quantification.
<P>
         Work by Aczel has shown that in a quite broad class of
         mathematical structures (which he calls `Lambda Structures') from
         which models of illative combinatory logic might be expected to be
         drawn, there can be no elements which correspond precisely to our
         intuitions about the required semantics of the logical operators
         (e.g. quantification).  These result are expressed as negative
         statements about `internal definability' within the model, of the
         relevant logical concept.
<P>
         Aczel goes on to define and then shows how to construct `Frege
         Structures' which are suitable as models for logical systems close
         to those of Frege.  In these models a semantics can be given to
         formula involving the necessary logical operators even though
         these do not denote values in the model (this is in fact the norm
         and the case also in first order logic, combinatory logic is
         exceptional in attempting to include these notions in the domain
         of discourse, though no unique, higher order logics also have this
         characteristic).  While Aczel provides ways of constructing sound
         logical systems supporting full comprehension, these systems
         nevertheless fall short of the ideals of combinatory logic, and
         his theoretical conclusions suggest that these ideals are not
         achievable.
<P>
         It may be noted however that the impossibility of constructing
         models which fully satisfy our intuitive requirements has not been
         felt a fatal flaw in classical set theory.  The iterative
         conception of the universe of sets on which logical systems like
         ZFC are based is an essentially incompletable construction.  This
         turns out not to be a problem, since we know that no formalisation
         of set theory can be complete as a consequence of Godel's work.
         In practice incomplete models of this universe of sets suffice to
         interpret these theories.  We therefore observe that classical set
         theory is not only formally incomplete, it is based on models
         which are essentially incompletable.  In the following we
         therefore propose members of families of logical systems which can
         be seen to be consistent relative to models which are simply
         approximations to the intended interpretations.  The systems may
         in principle have arbitrary proof theoretic strength, and the
         stronger the system the better its models approximate the ideal,
         but there are no complete systems, and no perfect models either.
<P>
         We offer arguments to support the claim that combinatory logics
         can be devised which satisfy the following requirements:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Unconstrained functional abstraction (which server also as
              set comprehension) and application.
<LI>Consistent
<LI>Of arbitrarily high proof theoretic strength.
</OL>

<P>
         Two qualifications should be noted before we proceed to greater
         detail.
<P>
         Firstly, though we require and supply unconstrained abstraction
         and application, we are not committed to the standard semantics.
         In the systems we consider application is strict, and this appears
         in the formal systems as a constraint on beta reduction.  We do
         not know whether this constraint is essential, but our arguments
         are only good in the presence of the constraint.
<P>
         Secondly, in relation to proof theoretic strength our claims are
         relative.  Results about consistency necessarily become less
         certain as apparent proof theoretic strength increases, since it
         is such strength is strongly correlated with how difficult it is
         to prove the system consistent.  Our claim is that, given some
         system with a certain proof theoretic strength, we can construct a
         reflexive combinatory system with at least as high a proof
         theoretic strength.  This result is obtained via some very general
         claims about how one logical system can `steal' proof theoretic
         strength from another.
<P>
         Our arguments are presented in three phases. 
<P>
         Firstly we construct a formal system lacking logical quantifiers
         which is capable of proving definite facts about computation
         together with some general facts expressed using free variables.
         The domain of discourse is natural numbers and computable
         functions over natural numbers as represented by an effective
         coding of functions into natural numbers.  A distinguished natural
         number denotes the true proposition, and a sequent is provable for
         any assignment of natural numbers to the variables in the sequent
         if the assumptions all evaluate to true then so does the
         conclusion. This system is easily shown to be consistent.
<P>
         Next we introduce a new constant name for restricted
         quantification together with some suitable rules.  This extension
         to the system is shown to be conservative.
<P>
         Finally we argue that the proof theoretic strength can by
         increased without limit by the addition of any finite number of
         true claims about the consistency of other formal systems.  The
         conditions under which proof theoretic strength can be transferred
         from one logical system to another by this method are discussed.
<P>
