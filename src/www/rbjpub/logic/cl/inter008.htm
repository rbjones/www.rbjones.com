<H1>The Problem</H1>
<P>
  
         To produce a Foundation System satisfying the following
         requirements:
<OL>
<LI>Consistent
<LI>Permitting unrestricted abstraction
<LI>Of open-ended proof theoretic strength
</OL>
<P>
<H2>Motivation</H2>
<P>
         The foundation system is to be used in software engineering as the
         logical basis for a software tool which is mathematically
         literate.  Users of this tool will need to have settled in
         principle issues of consistency, i.e. the tool will be able to act
         for them as a final arbiter of consistency.  Hence a high level of
         proof theoretic strength is required.
<P>
         Of the required characteristics:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Needs no justification
<LI>Is the primary requirement justifying foundational work.
<LI>See previous paragraph.
</OL>
<P>
      <H2>Background</H2>
<P>
         Frege began with unconstrained abstraction, however his system was
         found to be inconsistent.
<P>
         The solutions to the paradoxes \cite{Russell08,Zermelo08} both
         involved restrictions on abstraction.
<P>
         Though the main stream of mathematical logic abandoned practical
         application of formal systems to the construction of mathematical
         proofs, and was content with systems not admitting full
         abstraction, work on reflexive foundations has continued through
         to the present day.
<P>
         Among the work conducted in this tradition is that of Schonfinkel,
         Curry, Seldin and Bunder of a proof theoretic nature, and Finch,
         Scott and Aczel of a more model theoretic kind.  The problem which
         has dogged the field has been that of obtaining consistent systems
         with adequate expressiveness to provide a foundation for classical
         mathematics.  In combinatory logic the extra condition has
         generally been added that the number of forms of judgement is
         limited and that all other constructions are conducted by means of
         application of terms in the object language, which requires that
         the logical operators are values in the domain of discourse.
<P>
         Aczel's work on Frege structures provide negative results about
         such systems.  Aczel's work showed that in the general context of
         Lambda structures important logical operations could not be
         `internally defined', by which we may understand that the relevant
         logical operators are not to be found in the domain of discourse
         of the relevant models.  Scott and Aczel both published details of
         similar logical systems in which unrestrained abstraction is
         permitted but the logical operators are not values in the domain
         of quantification.  The proof theoretic strength of these systems
         is not known.
<P>
         It is the purpose of this paper to show that notwithstanding
         Aczel's negative results reflexive foundations supporting
         unrestrained abstraction and whose logical operations are
         represented in the domain of discourse can be constructed with
         arbitrarily high proof theoretic strength and shown to be
         consistent by model theoretic methods.  This is possible by the
         use of essentially incomplete models.  Each such model fails to
         capture fully the intended semantics of some to the logical
         operators, but represents an approximation good enough to show the
         consistency of formal systems up to a certain level of proof
         theoretic strength.  Formal systems of arbitrarily high proof
         theoretic strength can be shown to be consistent by arguing that a
         model providing a sufficiently good approximation to the intended
         meaning of the logical operators exists.
