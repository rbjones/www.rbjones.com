<H1>Perspectives on
<BR>
The Scope of Logic</H1>
<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5 CLASS=con><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
Enormous advances in mathematical logic have taken place over the last 150 years.
These advances have made logic a much more powerful tool than it had hitherto been.
<P>
The development of the digital computer in the latter part of this period further broadens the potential applicability of logic, making possible applications which would have otherwise been too complex to realise.
</TD><TD>
Our understanding the scope and limits of logic in application, though it too has advanced, has not yet caught up with these developments.
<P>
The short essays below are my first attempts to approach this problem.

Androids are often portrayed as more logical than us humans.
I think there's a lot of mileage in deliberately making artificial intelligence  completely logical, rather than simulating human fallibility.
