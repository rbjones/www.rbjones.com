Thanks to Andrzej Trybulec, as well as Czeslaw Bylinski, Grzegorz Bancerek and
Roman Matuszewski, for many interesting discussions and for looking after me
during my visit to Bialystok, where this paper was started. For making this
and other meetings of researchers possible, Bob Boyer deserves every credit; I
am grateful too for his encouragement to write this paper. I have also
benefited from conversations with Mike Gordon and with other people at the QED
conference, and with members of the Programming Methodology group at &#197;bo
Akademi. My visit to Poland was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research,
and my later work was supported by the U.K. Physical Sciences and Engineering
Research Council, the Isaac Newton Trust, and more recently by the European
Commission under the Human Capital and Mobility programme. Comments on early
drafts from Rob Arthan, Jim Grundy, Ken Kunen, Witold Marciszewski, Norm
Megill, Larry Paulson, Randy Pollack and Piotr Rudnicki have led to several
important improvements and corrections; I am also grateful for encouraging
reactions from many others. Thanks also to Roger Jones for undertaking an HTML
translation of an earlier version of this paper and to Witold Marciszewski for
arranging electronic publication in <EM> Mathesis Universalis</EM>.<A HREF="jrh01f.htm#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
