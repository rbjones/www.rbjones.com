Much theoretical work has been undertaken in Computer Science, mainly motivated by problems in the development of Information Systems, underpinning the development of formal methods.
Sometimes general positions are advocated on logic or the foundations of mathematics which, if correct, must also have ramifications for applications of formal methods in other disciplines.
(e.g. an advocacy of constructive or category theoretic foundations in preference to classical set theory, or of a thoroughgoing logical pluralism)
