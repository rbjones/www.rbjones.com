First understand that <I>anarchism</I> is a position on how influence should be exerted, favouring persuasion over compulsion.
As a political doctrine this entails abolition of the state if the state is conceived as essentially engaged in securing social order through compulsion (in the sense that if the same effects were achieved exclusively by persuasion then we would call the institutions involved <I>charities</I> rather than considering them part of <I>goverment</I>).</FONT>
</TD><TD WIDTH=50%><FONT SIZE=2>
We are concerned here to generalise this political anarchist doctrine:
<UL>
<LI>first, to encompass relations between more diverse groupings than those between the state and the individual (spreading along the P-P axis), and
<LI>second, to consider more subtle nuances in modes of exerting influence (moving up the E-L axis).

<CENTER><B>Relations between States</B></CENTER>
Harmonious and cooperative relations are to be preferred to conflict and war.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Government and the Individual</B></CENTER>
At its crudest anarchism advocates simply the abolition of the apparatus of the state in the belief that all those essential benefits which the state brings can be better achieved through voluntary cooperation.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Person to Person</B></CENTER>
At this level supportive rather than oppressive interpersonal relationships are advocated.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Relations with Self</B></CENTER>
Self-castigation is abjured.<BR>
Know thyself and be at one.

<CENTER><H3>The Emotional-Logical Axis</H3></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Logical</B></CENTER>
This mode of influence is purely intellectual.
It involves a philosophic detachment which makes it the least oppressive form of persuasion, but is strictly applicable only to logic and mathematics.
It does not suffice where <I>values</I> are at issue. 
<P>
<CENTER><B>Rhetorical</B></CENTER>
With rhetoric (which I am here using to mean any well presented case which goes beyond logical deduction) we can address issues beyond the scope of logic, while still presenting a case <I>on its merits</I>.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Emotional</B></CENTER>
At this level we exploit empathy and bonding to communicate a sense of importance which dispassionate discussion omits.
Like all forms of <A HREF="../rbj026.htm">magic</A>, emotional influence is powerful and can be abused.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Physical</B></CENTER>
Though physical preventive measure are sometimes desirable, physical coercion is almost always undesirable.
