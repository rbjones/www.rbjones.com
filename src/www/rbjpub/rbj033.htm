<FONT SIZE=2>
I first started developing this web site in 1994.
I decided to turn it into Factasia in 1996, intended but failed to ramp up development in 1998, and suspended development to work on another site (x-logic.org) early 2000
From there on things went speedily downhill and I seriously lost my way.
Now I'm trying to get going again, reviewing the rbjones.com website and aiming to deploy here the techniques for doing formal logic on the web which I developed for the x-logic site.
<P>
So I need a completely new strategy which takes account of who I now am and what I might hope to achieve.

<CENTER><B>Breadth AND Depth</B></CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>
You may have noticed that I'm trying to achieve the impossible: breadth <I>and</I> depth.
I'm very interested in logic, so its easy for me to think that <I><A HREF="logic/log006.htm">logic is important</A></I>.
But <A HREF="logic/rbj006.htm">is it?</A>
If I step back for a few seconds I have to recognise that, for most people in the world, logic is a rich man's entertainment.
Water is important.
That people should have clean drinking water is important, an end in itself.
Logic is a handy bag of tricks, only of value as a means to more vital ends.
<P>
Its very important to me to keep this in sight, and so I refuse to allow Factasia to focus down on a piece of technology.
I want to pay attention to what's really important, and to understand the way abstruse technologies can help us with the important issues.
<P>
So here's a piece of the strategy.
I'm painting on a huge canvass, and I'm painting <I>top down</I>, <I>breadth first</I>.
Its a bit like painting the Forth Bridge, trying to raise standards and fill in detail across the whole site.
But I also have one or two corners which get special attention.
50% of my time on a bit of <I>depth first</I>.
Logic is one, and logical truth is the deepest point so far.

<CENTER><B>Philosophy</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
If any single subject area has a special status it it philosophy, since philosophy is the only subject which <I>can</I> be as broad as Factasia <I>must be</I>.
Also, the method, across the piece, is just <I>meditation</I>.
<P>
My strategy is to use the (possibly tacky):
<CENTER><A HREF="philos/pos001.htm"><IMG SRC=../rbjgifs/globsupb.gif BORDER=0 ALT="The Global Superbrain" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=64></A>
</CENTER>
theme to encourage the philosophical side to focus on the real world.
This theme has two sides to it which connect both with the logical/analytic side of philosophy and also with the broader moral/social/polical/economic side, allowing the philosophy to be driven by practical purposes flowing from <I><A HREF="values/val004.htm">an articulated value system</A></I>.
</FONT>
<CENTER><B>Methods</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
I still need to fill out my story on logical methods.
This is what <I><A HREF="methods/fm/fm016.htm">A Framework for Formal Analysis</A></I> is about.
Philosophically fundamental to this is <I><A HREF="philos/logic/022.htm">the definition of logical truth</A></I> which is probably the deepest thing I am working on.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Throughout the site there are sketches of topics, most of which I intend eventually to fill out in greater detail.
So one way to get an idea of where I am going is to have a look over the site as is.
There are also some other pages which are intended to provide a forward picture at different levels.

and for some wild speculations about the future content and character of the site see:

Both of these pages are overdue for an upgrade.
