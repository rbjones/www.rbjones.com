<FONT SIZE=2>
Engineering design is a process in which an understanding of the physical world, sometimes embodied in quantitative (i.e. mathematical) scientific models, is used to devise a recipe for constructing physical entities (e.g. machines, buildings) or information structures (e.g. software) which satisfy some real human need.
Factasia is concerned with the modelling methods and tools which are made available to support engineering design.
We look forward to a future in which formal descriptions of required behaviour and of proposed structure enable automatic simulation for the evaluation of requirement and design, and in which these same formal descriptions provide the basis for increasing levels of automation of the design process.

<CENTER><B>Language Engineering</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The single most important need for the application of logic based techniques to the automation of engineering problem solving is the need for better languages.
First this means languages whose <I>meaning</I> is well defined.
Next it means well structured languages which avoid obscure imperative algorithmic specifications in favour of clear declarative specifications.
If the semantics is itself defined in a well defined formal notation that would be even better.
So the language engineering part of Factasia <I>will</I> be concerned with finding nice ways of designing languages which <I>not only</I> give well designed and well defined languages but also aid the building of tools to do things with the languages, including reasoning and problem solving.

<FONT SIZE=2>
The ultimate goal is the automation of design through the mechanisation problem solving using mathematical models.
The idea is to start with people providing the intelligence and computers providing good but not really "intelligent" support, mainly through mathematical modelling.
Then gradually we automate larger parts of the process and increase the problem solving capabilities of the software until there is a real collaboration between human designer and machine in creating a design which meets the requirements.
Ultimately it might be that the computers do all the design and human engineers are concerned only with working out the requirements, setting design standards, and further developing the software.
