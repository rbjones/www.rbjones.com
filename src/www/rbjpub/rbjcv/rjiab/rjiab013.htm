<P>
I suppose this is in the same spirit as "diary of a nobody", a celebration of failure.
But I havn't read it so that's just a speculation.
<P>
I have spent a lifetime diligently pursuing either unattainable or at least very hard objectives and have an exceptional level of experience in persistent failure.
The "how not to" series is an attempt to turn this wealth of experience into autobiographical sketches.
<P>
The two I have at the top of my priority list are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>How not to learn the piano.
<LI><A HREF="rjiab012.htm">How not to become a professional philosopher.</A>
</UL>
