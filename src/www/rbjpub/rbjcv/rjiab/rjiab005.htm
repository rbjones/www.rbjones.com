My first encounter with a digital computer.
I think it was a pegasus.
We were given a lesson on the programming language prior to visiting the computer in Bradford.
I coded up a digital to binary conversion routine, but was disappointed to discover that the resulting "binary numbers" contained lots of "9"s.
Still, apart from these unanticipated minor imprecisions, it worked fine.
<P>
The most enjoyable examination I ever did was the Cambridge Entrance exam.
The questions were really interesting.
I estimated the power which would be generated by a tidal barrage on the river seven.
Until they asked the question, I had no idea that I knew how to do it.
The other question I remember answering was about the design of a digital adder.
<P>
Cambridge offered me a place, and I turned down Manchester, who at that time had the only Computer Science course in the country.
On the face of it this was a mistake.
