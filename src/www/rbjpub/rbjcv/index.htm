<P>
This material started with me attempting a <A HREF="rbjcv001.htm"><EM>hypertext CV</EM></A>.
This hasn't really got very far.
I don't really have much idea what an ordinary CV ought to look like these days (I've worked for one company most of my life), and I'm not looking for a job (which is what they are for isn't it?), and I wasn't really able to feel much interested in the kind of material I could put in a CV.
<P>
So I thought about what might be more interesting for me to write about (so that there might just be a faint chance of it being interesting to someone else), and started picking at something which might be called an <A HREF="rjiab/index.htm"><EM>intellectual autobiography</EM></A>, i.e. a story of what I have <EM>thought about</EM>, or maybe even written about.
This hasn't got very far either, but it has a better chance.
<P>
I suspect that the CV will move off the rails and become an <EM>unconventional CV</EM>, full of the kind of details which noone in their right mind would put in a real CV.
<P>
I recently got access to a decent scanner and started scanning in some of my <A HREF="papers/index.htm"><EM>ancient writings</EM></A>.
These often hold a place in my affections wholly unrelated to their value to the world at large, and are just the kind of effusions which could only ever have been published on WWW.
<P>
