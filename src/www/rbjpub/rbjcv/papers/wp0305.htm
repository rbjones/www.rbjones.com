<H2>5 CONCLUSIONS</H2>
<P>
In discussing the exploitation of expert system it is not easy to
find a happy medium between an unrealistic overassessment of the
possibilities and an unduly conservative approach which more or less
misses the point.  I believe that most of the ideas I have presented
are necessary and possible rather than utopian and unrealistic.  Where
my suggestions go beyond the capabilities of existing expert systems
they do so in pursuit of a distributed expert capability fully
integrated with more conventional networked information processing
facilities.  This is inevitably a problem area which will be of greater
interest to commercial than to academic institutions, or at least,
which only becomes of interest as expert systems become commercially
viable products.
<P>
I conclude with a handful of what I consider to be key ideas, a
cautionary note, and a heartfelt plea.
<P>
<DL>
<DT>i)
<DD>Enable algorithmic techniques to be mixed with
     deductive techniques and don't write a set of rules
     where a subroutine can be supplied, (appropriate
     technology)
<DT>ii)
<DD>Enable full access to system resources to be obtained
     through expert systems (qua intelligent interfaces).
<DT>iii)
<DD>Support distributed knowledge bases.
</DL>
<P>
To these I add my cautionary note:
<DL>
<DT>iv)  Chose your applications carefully.
<P>
There really are a lot of problems which expert systems will not be
able to handle for us for a long time.  In particular, still, anything
that really requires intelligence.  Some guidelines can be laid down
for the shcrt term.  Amng them I suggest:
<P>
<DL>
<DT>a)
<DD>Don't expect an expert system to solve problems which
     your best available human expert can't solve. You might
     be lucky, but you probably won't be.  Someday they may
     be able to beat us but not yet.
<DT>b)
<DD>A careful systems analysis is essential, in particular
     a breakdown of all the information which a human being
     needs to solve the problem.  The expert system won't be
     able to solve the problem unless it has access to all the
     same information.
<DT>c)
<DD>Watch out for some of the intractable problem areas. A
     relevant one for ICL is understanding programs. If your
     problem requires you to look at a program listing and
     understand what it's doing then you're unlikely to get an
     expert system to solve it for you this century.  If you can
     go about solving your problem in a reasonably systematic
     way, with maybe a few judgements of a woolly nature that you
     wouldn't know how to program, then you may be O,K. with an
     expert systen, but if you have to pace up and down till your
     brain aches awaiting inspiration, then the problem is all
     yours.  And of course, if the main problems are human
     problems, persuading people, or understanding them, then
     there is no hcpe.
</DL>
</DL>
And finally for my plea.
<P>
The most impressive thing about the Japanese fifth generation report
is neither their ambitious objectives, nor the techniques they propose
for attaining then.  It is the appearance of a substantial collection
of papers all working in a well co-ordinated way towards the same
overall objective. One is immediately made avare of the fragmentary
nature of western research.
<P>
By contrast, the Alvey Report, which is more or less Britain's answer
to the 'fifth generation' seems a despondent half hearted venture. It
explicitly doubts that British Industry will collaborate without being
given financial inducements to do so, and even though proposing that
government funds be applied to secure this essential collaboration,
the proposals comes across as being, by constrast, rather fragmentary.
<P>
Notwithstanding the lack of any co-ordinated assault by British
Industry there remains a real possibility that ICL, with some
collaboration with other companies, could make good progress by
itself.  To be successful in this ICL needs to mobilise all its best
creative talents throughout the company.  This should not be viewed as
a few new isolated product developments, it is rather, a new approach
to the relationship between man and machine which should leave few
products untouched.
<P>
ICL sells products to meet the information processing requirements of
its customers, and in doing so its main activities are themselves
processing information.  Expert systems techniques are the last
element in the jigsaw which provides an information processing
facility capable of handling all an organisations information
processing requirements with a mininum number of staff dedicated to
computerese.  They offer not only a new direction for our products,
but also a means of substantially improving our own 'information
productivity".
<P>
To achieve all these wonderful things, it really is quite essential
that we all work together, and the most important element in working
together is good communications. Notwithstanding the requirements of
security, we cannot produce an integrated set of products if we do not
know to what goal we are aiming, and we will not lead in the
technology of the fifth generation if the parts of the company working
on expert systems do not talk to each other or to anyone else.
