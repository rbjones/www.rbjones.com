<P>
This position paper presents an approach to the design and development
of environments for the production of computer systems for which we
require to have very high degrees of assurance of correctness.
<P>
The approach is shaped by particular concern for:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>a)</TD>
<TD>The soundness of the logical framework within which the
     correctness of the implementations is to be established,
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>b)</TD>
<TD>The inviolacy of the logical framework to errors on the part of
     the user.
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>c)</TD>
<TD>The means whereby the correctness of the implementation of the
     environment may be assured.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
In consequence the following characterise the approach proposed:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>i)</TD>
<TD>The approach is "foundational' rather than axiomatic. By this we
     mean that a single logical foundation is to be established during
     system design, and that users are permitted only definitional
     facilities which are guaranteed not to compromise the consistency
     of the foundation.</TD>
</TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>ii)</TD>
<TD>
The foundation is supported by some philosophical examination of
     the nature of logical truth, and by careful examination of the
     intended domain of discourse (our "ontology") and the required
     expressiveness of the logic.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>iii)</TD>
<TD>
Both the foundation and its implementation are "reductionist".
     This means that the foundation is constructed from the simplest
     possible core, by the process of introducing new definitions, new
     syntactic forms, and exploiting (proven) derived rules of
     inference.  The implementation is similarly to be built from a
     very small core in a carefully structured way.   This reductionism
     is intended to provide maximal confidence in the consistency of
     our formal system, and the correctness of its implementation. We
     expect it to lead also to economies in implementation.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>iv)</TD>
<TD>
The foundation is type-free. A type system is to be constructed
     over the foundation for the purpose of providing transparent means
     of specifying the properties of the entities in the domain of
     discourse.  These objects remain type-free, in the sense that
     self-application is permitted and polymorphic functions are "first
     class" entities,</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Our philosophical position has an intuitionistic flavour. We take the
(absolute) truths of logic to be those statements which correctly
express the consequences of applying correctly some effective
procedure.   We suppose the correctness of execution of the elementary
steps of an effective procedure to be supportable only by an appeal to
the intuition.     This philosophical position provides some of the
motivation for reducing our formal system to the smallest possible
core.  This ensures that our intuitions are relied upon no more than is
inescapable.
<P>
Three levels of language are currently envisaged, each corresponding
also to a system architecture, and a stage in development, The lowest
level is illustrated by a formal system corresponding closely to pure
combinatory logic.   The middle level is intended to be    an application
independent type theory,      The types in this system     correspond to
(partial) specifications and to recursively enumerable sets of terms
which satisfy the specifications. At the third level       are the prime
languages for system development including abstract        specification
languages and implementation languages.    Where possible  specifications
for implementations will be expressed in extensions to the programming
language type system.      The semantics of all these languages is
ultimately expressed in terms of our primitive logical foundation, and
hence the development is axiomatic only in the core foundation system.
