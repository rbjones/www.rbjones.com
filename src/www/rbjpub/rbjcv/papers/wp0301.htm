1.	INTRODUCTION
<P>
The writing of this paper was started as part of an attempt to secure
myself a job which would exercise my interest in Artificial
Intelligence.  It was written without benefit of a significant amount
of research, entirely in my own time.
<P>
My qualifications for being considered an authority in this field are
insubstantial, I have no practical experience in Expert Systems and
little experience of the superstructure (or other) products most
likely to be affected by such developments, but my interest in
Artificial Intelligence spans a period of more than fifteen years.  I
have found writing this paper an interesting and stimulating exercise,
and have had no difficulty in persuading myself that some of the ideas
presented have merit.  I hope therefore that it may prove of interest.
<P>
It is tedious and space consuming to preface each assertion with
indications of uncertainty and incompetence, and I have therefore
written the rest of the paper in an unwarranted but brief tone of
authority.
<P>
The paper consists of three main sections.  The first (section 2) was
written in deference to some doubt on my part about whether I and the
rest of the company understood the same thing by the term 'Expert
System' (occasioned in part by the blank looks I sometimes get when I
suggest that an understanding of logic insight be relevant).
<P>
Section 3 was written not intentionally but compulsively.  I am
persuaded that the techniques involved in expert systems will be very
important in the medium, to long term future of computing, both in
influencing, and in permitting the exploitation of new architectures.
I believe that success will not be a matter of having the best
semiconductor (or superconductor) technology, nor of making the
largest investment in 'the fifth generation'.  It will require a clear
vision of how to exploit effectively the techniques developed and
developing in Artificial Intelligence labs throucthout the world.  ICL
could be in the forefront of these new developments.
<P>
Section 4 deals more directly with the problems involved in
effectively integrating expert systems into our products.
<P>
Frequent reference is rode to the objectives, and the methods proposed
for their attainment, of the Japanese 'Fifth Generation' project.  In
doing so I do not wish to imply that we should be engaged in slavishly
following the Japanese.  Simply that they should not lightly be
dismissed.  There are few other sources of serious (whether credible
or not) suggestions on how we can exploit the advances of technology.
<P>
A 'conclusion' is supplied, to prevent the unwitting but persistent
reader from falling off the end of the paper.
