2.	WHAT ARE EXPERT SYSTEMS
<P>
<A NAME="2.1"></A>
2.l   Academic usage
<P>
The term 'expert system', in its recent usage, was coined by the
academic community engaged in research into Artificial
Intelligence(AI) to describe their increasingly successful attempts to
exploit the techniques of AI in practically useful systems. Expert
systems developed in these environments are many and varied.  The most
successful systems typically provide an expert problem-solving or
advice-giving capability at a level which requires considerable
knowledge of and experience in the problem domain, and which matches
or exceeds the capability of human experts.  The interfaces to these expert systems are usually suitable for use by people with no
computing experience, though since they are often intended to assist
experts in the field they may assume an understanding of specialist
terminology in the problem domain.
<P>
It is an important characteristic many of these of these systems that
they incorporate generalised problem solving capabilities and there is
at least a conceptual distinction between the problem solving
capability and the knowledge base on which this operates.  This
knowledge base supplies (domain specific and general knowledge
essential to expertise, but without the inference system which
operates upon it the solution of problems with this information would
not be possible.  Thus the expert system can be decomposed into
interfacing and inference capabilities which are relatively domain
independent, and a knowlelge base containing the necessary domain
specific 'knowledge'.  This decomposability of expert systems is
exploited in knowledge engineering systems such as SAGE and ICLX,
which are intended to allow a user with expertise in the problem
domain but limited knowledge of the techniques of AI to construct an
expert system by suppplying the necessary information to build up the
knowledge base.
<P>
Some of the important problem areas in expert systems are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a)   Knowledge representation and Knowledge base organisation.
<LI>b)   General problem solving techniques and 'heuristics'.
<LI>c)   Human interfacing problems (natural language, spoken
       language, and other techniques).
</UL>
These indeed form central themes in the Japanese fifth generation
project, in which special hardware is poroposed for each of these
problem areas.  For ICL, however, a problem area of greater importance
is that of integrating knowledge engineering systems and knowledge
engineering techniques into the existing product range, in such a way
that full access to and optimal utilisation of system facilities and
resources is poss-ible through expert subsystems without impacting upon
the efficiency of more traditional methods.
<P>

2.2      The inevitable future dilution
<P>
Once a market for 'expert systems' is established, it will inevitably
be the case that manufacturers and software houses will use the labe I
as widely as they credibly can.  Since customers will not be familiar
with academic usage, they will learn to understand by the term 'expert
system' the sort of product which is typically dished up under that
label, which will often be no more than a cosmetic adjustynent to last
years packages, and will normally be much less 'intelligent' than the
better products of university research projects.  This trend is quite
normal and largely harmless, The most unfortunate consequence is that
it makes it more difficult to understand what we mean by 'expert
system', do we mean an even more user friendly package, or do we mean
the real thing?
<P>

2.3      Japanese usage
<P>
There can be no doubt that the aim of the Japanese fifth generation
project is intended to implement oroducts which radically exceed the
capabilities of existing bona-fide expert systems.  The architecture
of the proposed fifth generation computers is entirely built around
the features of academic expert systems, to the extent that language
executed by the processors will be based on a language hitherto
confined to academic circles (PROLOG) and the targets for performance
of those processors are expressed in 'Lips' (Logical Inferences per
second).
<P>
Though we, may be sceptical about whether the Japanese will achieve all
their targets, it would be unrealistic to suppose that they will fail
to improve upon systems which are already operational on existing
hardware and so we may be sure that some suppliers will be offering
genuine expert system.
<P>
<A NAME="2.4"></A>
2.4   ICL usage
<P>
If our competitors are generally marketing a wide range of products as
expert system it would be foolish, and indeed misleading of ICL not
to follow popular usage.  Broadening of the application of the term
should not however be permitted to result in a lowering of our
objectives.  It is important that we do not allow ourselves to fall
behind in this important area. It may prove necessary to invent a new
terminology for bona-fide expert systems.  Good expert systems will
however be able to sell themselves, whatever the terminology.
