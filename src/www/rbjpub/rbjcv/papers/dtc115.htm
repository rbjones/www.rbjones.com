5.   APPLICATION LANGUAGES
<P>
The expressiveness of our formal system is sufficient we believe to
define the denotational semantics of application development languages.
By providing a logically secure framework within which specialised type
theories with matching derived inference rules may be established, we
hope to enable a close fit between application languages and
specification languages.   This may enable a development methodology in
which specifications are evolved into implementations by stages which
are supported by automatic verification.
