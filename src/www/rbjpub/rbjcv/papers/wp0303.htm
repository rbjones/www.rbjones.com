3     EXPERT SYSTEMS AND HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT
<P>
<A NAME="3.1"></A>
3.1	The decline and fal1 of the mainframe
<P>
Three factors contribute to the projected decline in the profits which
ICL can take from mainframw computers.
<P>
a)   The market for medium to large computers is not expanding
<P>
The market for large computers is growing now much more slowly than
that for minis and micros.  This is partly due to rapidly improving
technology which enables virtually all the epansion in processing
power to be supplied with no increase in costs or revenues.
<P>
b)   The proportion of the value of a large computer systems
     which resides in the central processor is declining.
<P>
Improvements in technology are more effective in reducing the cost of
the processor than of the peripheral systems.  Since ICL buys in mast
of its peripherals this trend erodes the added value supplied by ICL
and hence ICL profits.
<P>
c)  The proportion of the value of a processor which is
    accounted for by the components is increasing.
<P>
As more and more components are packed onto each chip, the ratio of
component costs to assembly and other costs is increaslng, Since ICL
does not make components the value added by ICL is further eroded and
profits fall.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2"></A>
3.2    The revival
<P>
Expert systems will I believe play a vital role among a number of
factors which will during the next decade cause a reversal in the
decline described above.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2.1"></A>
3.2.l  The need for more processing power
<P>
Expert systems are open-ended mill consumers.  This is because they
typically involve searching through state spaces looking for (optimal)
solutions to some problem.  These state spaces would in the absence of
good techniques for selecting avenues for exploration prove
combinatorially intractable (i.e. take too long to search).  Much of
the research in Artificial Intelligence has been directed towards
developing 'heuristics' which effectively prune the search space to
manageable proportions.  Nevertheless mill power remains an important
factor in determining the Limitations of present day expert systems,
and it is nost unlikely that in the forseeable future expert systems
will fail to be thus limited.
<P>
The Japanese clearly believe that the expert systems of the future
will be big consmers of mill.  Their target for the power of the
fifth generation computers ten years hence is 100 M Lips - 1 G Lips,
one 'logical inference' takes between 100 and 1000 instructions on
present architectures, so their target gives a machine which is as
powerful (qua inference engine) as a 10 Gip Von Neumann machine.
(taking the lower figure in both cases)
<P>
To some extent the mill requirements of expert systems can be expected
to be distributed. Each individual user of expert decision support
systems will expect a good proportion of his requirements to be
supplied locally, which will itself provoke rapid increases in the
power of personal workstations.  This is only possible where the
distributed system is supporting many users, each with relatively
moderate problems.  Big problems will be solved more economically on
big processors, and large companies will find that such investments
pay.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2.2"></A>
3.2.2   The diminishing importance of chip fabrication technology
<P>
For many years now the improvement in performance of processors has
derived predominantly frcm improvaments in component technology. The
significance of hardware architecture or of software has been
relatively limited, in its impact on cost performance figures.  The
architecture of processors, mainfraine or micro, has not changed a
great deal.  This has enabled the design of microprocessors to be
accomplished by quite small teams of engineers employed mainly by
component manufacturers or companies with their own in house
fabrication technology.
<P>
This trend has reduced the value added by manufacturers who are not
vertically integrated, and has hence reduced their potential profits.
<P>
Though we can expect to see continuing rapid improvements in component
technology, there are signs that this will be of dimishing
significance by comparison with architectural problems and software
problems.  In addition, the monopoly which component manufacturers
have had in the design of components shows signs of breaking up. ICL
is already exploiting some of the first signs of this break-up in its
use of Fujitsu gate arrays.
<P>
In the past custom VLSI chips have been designed in random logic by
engineers with special knowledge of the technology.  This enabled
greater effective density to be achieived and hence resulted in more
competitive products.  The increasing complexity of VLSI circuits
makes this sort of technique decreasingly viable, and progressively
reduces the performance advantage obtained over more systematic
computer aided design processes, as computer aided design becomes
more extensively used for chip design, the relevance of specialist
knowledge of the fabrication technology diminishes, and the design of
the chip becomes largely a matter of logic rather than engineering.
This opens the way for the 'silicon foundry' which fabricates silicon
components to specifications supplied by the customer and processed by
a design automation system.  Such silicon foundries substantially
reduce the disadvantage of not being vertically integrated.  They
enable companies such as ICL to have early access to technological
advances, and they return to the computer manufacturer the design
role.
<P>
This process is already well progressed.   The Japanese fifth
generation project thought entirely based on custom VLSI, will have
no in house fabrication capability.  All chips will be fabricated by
subcontractors, who, provided they ,meet the quality standards, need
not be Japanese.  This means that ICL will have access to the same
technology, and the best systen will be produced by he who best solves
the architectural and software problem.  As seen by the Japanese the
problem is one of providing genuinely expert capabilities by the
exploitation of vastly parallel architectures.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2.3"></A>
3.2.3     The increasing importance of architecture and software
<P>
The significance in the future of differences in hardware architecture
(just how do we organise all this silicon?) and software engineering
(knowlelge base organisation, inference techniques, heuristics,
exploitation of hardware parallelism), will far outstrip the
significance of the underlying fabrication technology.  More of the
factors determining the effective performance of processors will be
within the domain of the computer designer rather than the component
manufacturer.   Automation in the design and production of components
will enable much more use to be made of specialist hardware for
different functions within the network.  Hardware design will become
less clearly distinct from software development and a greater
flexibility about which functions are in silicon and which in software
will result.  All this is good news for systems designers, and
increases the amount of added value contributed by the computer
designer.
<P>
<A NAME="3.3"></A>
3.3      The strength of ICL
<P>
Some of the main areas of research in the Japanese fifth generation
project are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a)   Development and exploitation of highly parallel
     architectures in the central processor.
<LI>b)   Development of powerful parallel knowledge base
     management processor.
<LI>c)   Developnent of high power personal workstations.
</UL>
These are all areas in which ICL has quite well advanced products
(DAP, CAFS and RDBMS, PERQ), and in which we can stay out front so
long as we do not rest on our laurels.  Substantial further
development will be necessary to keep ahead in any of these areas if
the Japanese come anywhere near acheiving their targets.
<P>
For example, DAP, though probably the most flexible parallel
processing architecture commercially available, is nevertheless
unlikely to be satisfactory for a parallel inferential capability.
Although DAP is not contrained to parallelism in respect of floating
point operations identically executed on large numbers of data items
(as are most parallel processors), it is nevertheless constrained to
doing pretty much the same thing on large amounts of data, be it
floating point or not.  This is a consequence of their being but the
one program controlling simultaneously all the processors in the
array.  General problem, solving systems are unlikely to profit from
this sort of architecture, requiring rather, an organisation in which
each of the processors is more autonomous, allowing them to be
allocated subproblems which are quite distinct.  In such a context a
heirarchic organisation of separately program controlled processors
might be more appropriate than an array of commonly controlled
processors. The Japanese appear intent upon stepping away from Von
Neumann architectures altogether, in favour of 'data flow'
architectures.
<P>
Similar advances will also be required in the other areas as well, it
is unlikely to sufficient to produce cheaper functional
replacements utilising more advanced component technology.  It would
be more appropriate to evaluate what more can be done with the new
technology and revise the specifications upwards, this should however
be done as part of a long term program which anticipates the rate of
progress of the technology and aims at all times to 'intercept'.  The
importance of software developments in this process is likely to be
considerable.  The architectures of the future are likely to be
unsuitable for human programming, and the ability to exoloit (and
hence to sell) them will depend on having software expert enough to
make use of them.
<P>
<A NAME="3.4"></A>
3.4  The Importance of Expert Systems
<P>
I submit therefore that 'expert system' are crucial to the marketing
of large numbers of powerful processors in the following ways:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>a)    Without expert systems most customers will have no use
      for large amounts of processing power.
<LI>b)   Without expert systems no-one will be able to program
     complex parallel architectures.
</UL>
<P>
At the other end of the scale, increasing volume sales of less
powerful systems will also depend upon the exploitation of expert
systems techniques.  This is because they will need to cope with
people who simply don't understand computers, or people who's time is
too valuable to be spent tailoring their problems to the computer
system.  They will want to explain their problems in the terms in
which they understand them, and will require the responses to be
immediately comprehensible.
