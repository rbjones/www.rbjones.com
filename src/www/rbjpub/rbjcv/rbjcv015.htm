<P>
<H2>12/87-06/95 - High Assurance Team leader</H2>
<P>
    During this period the ICL High Assurance Team has undertaken a variety
    of applications in the secure systems area as well as a major technology
    development R&D project which has resulted in the ICL ProofPower system,
    a proof tool supporting formal reasoning in Higher Order Logic and Z.
<P>
    Lead the team engaged in the formal modelling and verification of the
    OWR, a device developed by ICL under contract to HMG and certified by HMG
    as ``exceeding the requirements for UKL6'' (a level of assurance
    corresponding to DoD A1 level), probably the most highly assured secure
    device in the world.  Contributed to consultancy contracts for HMG
    concerning methods for the formal modelling of secure systems and the
    application of those methods to secure systems developments for HMG.
<P>
    Conceived of the FST project ``Foundations and Tools for Formal
    Verification'', established the project and managed through to a
    succesful conclusion resulting in the ProofPower system supporting formal
    specification and proof in Higher Order Logic and Z, including prototype
    support for the Spark Annotation Language..
<P>
    Made an important technical contribution to the approach to support of Z in
    HOL, including formal specifications of the semantic mappings.
    Involved in the ongoing development of the Z standard. 
<P>
    January 1986 - November 1987
<P>
    Formal Methods consultant applying formal methods to high assurance
    secure systems.
<P>
    Contributed to early formal modelling work for CESG, undertaking the
    first translation of formal models from Z to HOL for purposes of formal
    proof.
    Played a leading role in the establishment of techniques for using HOL to
    reason about specifications in Z.
