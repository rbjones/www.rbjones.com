<P>
I was born on 18th February 1948 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England.
<P>
I attended <A HREF="rbjcv005.htm">Ermysted's Grammar School</A> (doing double-maths and physics to A level) and went from there to read Mechanical Sciences at <A HREF="rbjcv003.htm">Churchill College</A> (but only stayed one year).
<P>
I then joined the <A HREF="rbjcv004.htm">English Electric Company</A>
for whom I worked for about 18 months on compiler-compilers and power transmission network analysis software before moving to <A HREF="rbjcv011.htm">ICL</A>, where I mostly worked on compilers.
<P>
In 1972 I returned to full time education as an undergraduate at 
<!A HREF="keel.htm">The University of Keele</A>, getting joint honours in Maths and Philosophy, and then moved on to postgraduate studies in computer science at <!A HREF="warw.htm">The University of  Warwick</A>.
<P>
In 1977 I rejoined <A HREF="rbjcv011.htm#77H">ICL</A> with whom I remained in full time employment until February 1998 in technical and managerial roles related to software development.
<P>
In 1998 I left ICL and formed my own company <A HREF="../bus/rbjltd/index.htm">Roger Bishop Jones Limited</A>.
<P>
In addition to the historical material which can be obtained by following the above links a <A HREF="rbjcv010.htm">Summary of Experience</A> is provided.
