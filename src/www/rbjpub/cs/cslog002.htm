As calculators they score high.
<P>
They do lightning, precise numerical calculations and symbolic transformations better than people.
<P>
Get the picture from the <A HREF="http://gams.cam.nist.gov/">Guide to Available Mathematical Software</A>.

But they have technique rather than knowledge, they do not <I>understand</I>, and their general problem solving skills are weak for this reason.
<P>
On the scale of mathematical sophistication computers are 2500 years behind people.

<CAPTION><B>Abstraction and Re-use</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD><FONT SIZE=2>
Abstraction is the very essence of mathematics, and the purpose of abstraction is re-use.
<P>
For 2500 years since classical Greece, mathematicians have constantly sought the right concepts, notations and theories to underpin applications in commerce, science and engineering.
<P>
Chosing the right concepts and notations is essential to effective re-use and until computing builds upon mathematics it will fail to realise the true potential for re-use.

<FONT SIZE=2>
You need people to decide what a computer should do.
Once that is settled it should be up to the computer to sort out the details.
<P>
Precise communication of requirements by dialogue with the computer should mark the end of human involvement, the computer will program itself.
<P>
Most people won't even think about programs, they will just have problems which computers help them to solve.

Its no use idealising about how things <I>should</I> be done, its won't happen that way in the real world.
Or will it?</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

When computing power is piped into the home like electricity, there will be coherent global standards for representation of information.

A universal <I>lingua characteristica</I> based in pure logic will dissolve many of today's integration problems.
