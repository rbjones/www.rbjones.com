<P>
The <I>digital revolution</I> arises from the transition from analogue to digital encoding of diverse kinds of information for distribution to consumers or use in commerce or industry.
The importance of this transition lies in the additional functionality  which can be delivered when digital information is processed by digital electronics, particularly increasingly powerful microprocessors.
<P>
The transition to digital representations is only the beginning of the story.
Deliverable functionality depends not only on whether information representation is digital, but also on what kind of digital representation is used; upon what information is present and how it is encoded.
<P>
Digital (or symbolic) information representations have been evolving over many years now and the different kinds of representation currently available can be related to the functionality deliverable by software working with these kinds of representation.
<P>
With <I>computer-aided design</I> for architects in mind <A HREF="http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/~malcolm/DDM/DDMmain.html">Digital Design Media</A> includes this kind of information.
<P>
The dependency between data content, form and program functionality results in a plethora of different kinds of data format, which impacts the cost of software production and the prospect for good integration between packages.
It is natural to seek abstractions which help to reduce this babel.
One such is the Standard Generalised Markup Language, which seems primarily to standardise some features of syntax.
Logic is another, though a two edged sword.
