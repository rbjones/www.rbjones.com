IT Systems Integration, Consultancy, and many IT Services have in common that they address a customer's problem in the most expensive possible way.
<P>
They do it by the dedicated application of skilled and expensive IT staff to the problem of a single customer.
<P>
In an industry not only dedicated to automation, but also to automation of what were previously exclusively human intellectual activities, these approaches to problem solving should be thought of as the luddite rearguard of IT.
<P>
There may be areas of IT where personal service will remain indispensible.

</TD><TD><FONT SIZE=2>
However, the cost disadvantages are so enormous, by comparison with automated approaches which can be replicated across the globe with near zero marginal cost, that we can expect in the future to find these personal service zones squeezed by relentless and enormous economic pressures.
<P>
For an aircraft manufacturer system integration is a problem at the core of his business.
He will never be able to build aircraft without doing systems integration.
<P>
Integration of IT systems is not an eternal problem.
<P>
It is a grudge purchase which will be eliminated by the commoditisation of computation.
Information processing will be supplied to factory, office and home alike in much the same way as electricity, gas, and telecommunications.

The problem of integration is a problem of language and its standardisation.
To make the integration problem go away we have to make the use of computing power independent of the details of the particular computers in use, and we have also to separate more effectively our understanding of what is required from any proposal about how it should be achieved.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

Will Java do the trick?
<P>
Perhaps, at one level.
It is an attempt at a platform independent language itself provoked by the pressure to uniformity arising in global networks.
