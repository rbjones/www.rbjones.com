<H1>On The Semantics of Z</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
The first formal treatment of the semantics of Z was provided by Mike Spivey in his doctoral dissertation.
This was published by Cambridge University Press as <A HREF=../philos/bibliog/s.htm#Spivey88><EM>Understanding Z</EM></A>.
Though this work does not cover the whole language (a crucial omission being <EM>set generic</EM> constructs), and is in some ways unnecessarily difficult to understand (e.g. in its handling of scope), it is still the most precise and intelligible semantic account available.
<P>
Since the early 90's a comprehensive formal semantics has been under development as a part of the Z standardisation process.
Drafts of this standard are available from the Oxford University archive server.
<P>
Having watched this patch since starting work with Z in 1986, I became active early in 1990 because of my role in the development of ProofPower, particularly in the design of the features supporting proof in Z (<A HREF=csfm06.htm>background</A>).
<P>
As a result of this work, I identified certain <A HREF=csfm05.htm>issues in relation to the semantics of Z</A> which seemed to have impact on the feasibility of constructing formal machine checked proofs about specifications written in Z.
These topics have also been discussed in the context of the Z standardisation process, and some of the changes I advocated are now incorporated in the draft standard.
