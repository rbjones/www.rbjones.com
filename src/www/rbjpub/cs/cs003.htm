<P>
Is Computer Science really a <EM>science</EM>? And does it matter?
<P>
It does matter whether the objectives persued and the methods
adopted are appropriate to the field.
The perception of computing as a science has an impact in these areas.
The term <EM>science</EM> is too apt to be confused with <EM>empirical science</EM>, 
and empirical sciences have objectives and methods which are inappropriate
for Computer Science.
<P>
Empirical sciences are primarily concerned with establishing empirical truths by experimental methods.
Computer Science is arguably not itself concerned with establishing empirical truths at all.
 It consists in part of theoretical studies which are properly considered either as logic or as pure or applied mathematics, and of Information Systems Engineering, a discipline which makes
use of empirical knowledge established in other disciplines, and appropriate logical or mathematical methods, and is concerned
with methods for constructing information processing systems.
