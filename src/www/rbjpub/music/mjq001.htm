The lyrics of "Beat It" express something I would do if I were in trouble.
Its message - that we should abhor violence - is something I deeply believe.
It tells kids to be smart and avoid trouble.
I don't mean to say you should turn the other cheek while someone kicks in your teeth, but, unless your back is against the wall and you have absolutely no choice, just get away before violence breaks out.

If you fight and get killed you've gained nothing and lost everything.
You're the loser, and so are the people who love you.
Thats what "Beat It" is supposed to get across.
To me true bravery is settling differences without a fight and having the wisdom to make that solution possible.
