<CENTER><H3>Varieties of Epistemology on WWW</H3></CENTER>
The view of epistemology which you will get via WWW is warped by two factors which distinguish this medium from other publishing media.
<P>
The <I>first</I> is that the population of readers, and more importantly of writers, using this medium is high on people who use or work with computers a lot, and probably low on the kind of people who write about epistemology in the real world.
The <I>second</I> is that this medium lacks all the controls on publication found in the traditional media, and therefore attracts people who have difficulty in publishing anywhere else.
<P>
I find it refreshing.
By contrast with professional philosophers, outsiders who feel they need to know or write about epistemology (and there are quite a lot of them) often do so for non-academic reasons.
They are likely to know the difference between a theory of knowledge and a discussion about the meaning of the word "know", because the theory they seek is expected to help them achieve some objective (e.g. building an artificial intelligence) which a discussion of the meaning of the word will not do.
