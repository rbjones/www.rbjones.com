<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>An analytic judgement is one whose subject matter is abstract or conceptual.
<P>
It tells us about the relationships between concepts, or about the characteristics of abstract entities, not about the nature of the material world.
<P>
Knowing the meaning of the concepts, and engaging in some process of logical analysis, suffices to establish the truth of an analytic judgement.
</TD><TD>
A synthetic judgement reaches out to the real world, employing concepts to make a statement about <I>how things are</I> as a matter of fact.
<P>
Concepts here are the vehicle for a substantive assertion which excludes certain otherwise possible configurations of the material universe.
<P>
Knowing the meaning of concepts and language will not suffice to establish anything about the real world which is their subject matter, for this empirical observation is necessary.
</TD><TD WIDTH="35%">
An evaluative judgement takes one further step.
<P>
Beyond <I>description</I> of how the world is, an evaluative judgment <I>expresses an attitude</I> toward that world.
It stems from our vital interest in the world and plays a role in shaping that world.
<P>
Not all judgements which we might consider evaluative go beyond description in this way, but for our present purposes the term will be used exclusively for "<I>properly</I>" evaluative judgements which do have non-descriptive content.

Its worth mentioning also the general notion of <I>performative</I> utterences, studied at length by J.L.Austin, just by way of allowing that the above classification is not exhaustive.
