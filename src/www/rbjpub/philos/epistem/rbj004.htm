<P>
You might think that speculation is the opposite of <A HREF="rbj003.htm"><EM>scepticism</EM></A> since it consists in giving credence to propositions for which our evidence is tenuous, while scepticism casts doubt even upon those propositions for which are evidence is strongest.
<P>
I prefer to think of speculation as being complementary to scepticism.
They may be used together to good effect.
(the true contrary to scepticism is dogmatism, and without speculation creativity is stifled)
