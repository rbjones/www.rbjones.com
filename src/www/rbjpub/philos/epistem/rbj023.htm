Central to Hume's skeptical epistemology is the distinction which he draws most clearly in his enquiry (<A TARGET="_top" HREF="../classics/hume/index.htm">ECHU</A> <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../classics/hume/echu041.htm">Section IV Part 1</A>) between "Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact" recognising that the former can be proven with great certainty but that the latter cannot.
Logicist Epistemology also affirms <A TARGET="_top" HREF="rbj013.htm">the fundamental triple dichotomy</A>.
Hume's denial that an <I>ought</I> can be derived from an <I>is</I> introduces a third category of value judgements giving us <A TARGET="_top" HREF="rbj017.htm">Two epistemological triads</A> and <A TARGET="_top" HREF="rbj016.htm">Three kinds of judgement</A>.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Having established the essential difference, Hume then goes on to separate the sheep from the goats, enumerating many different kinds of proposition which, because they concern matters of fact, are not susceptible of demonstrative proof and cannot therefore be known with certainty.
The goats include all empirical generalisations and inductive inference, even to probabilistic conclusions.
Science and morality transcend logic and lack its certainty.

Hume's ideas are not only applicable to curbing the excesses of rationalist philosphers.
They are applicable to more modern problems, telling us limits on what can reliably be established by artificial intelligence, however far our technology may progress.
Hume's skepticism is a precursor to the <A HREF="#Exploitation">exploitation</A> thread of Logicist Epistemology, which concerns the scope of applicability of deductive reason.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Though in the most prominent parts of his philosophy, particularly in his <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../classics/hume/index.htm">Enquiries</A> Hume affirms the certainty attained by demonstrative proof, he does pause to doubt even this.
In "A Treatise on Human Nature", Book 1, Part IV, Section 1, he still affirms that a demonstrative proof confers certainty, but admits that one can be mistaken about whether he is in posession of such a proof.

<CENTER><B>Doubting a Proof Checker</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Just as people can be mistaken about the correctness of a proof, so can machines be.
Proper care should therefore be taken in building an analytic superbrain that it does not make such mistakes.
Since the checking of proofs is mechanical this comes to the correctness of the algorithms fulfilling this purpose in the superbrain.
The epistemic status of a claim to correctness for such a system is just one of many epistemological problems associated with engineering an analytic superbrain.

Though Hume did not himself doubt that a proof conferred certainty, we can and should.
Advances in modern logic have taught us that we can be mistaken not only about whether our proof is correct, but also about whether our logic is sound.
The <A HREF="#Implementation">implementation</A> aspect of logicist epistemology is concerned with this kind of foundational problem.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Hume had a very <I>black and white</I> attitude to the relevance of demonstrative reasoning to establishing a conclusion.
Since matters of fact are not susceptible of demonstrative proof, and even statements of probability about such facts cannot be proven demonstratively, demonstrative reasoning must be wholly irrelevant to establishing them.
Importantly, he took this to mean that belief in matters of fact cannot be <I>rationally</I> supported.
He seemed to believe that for a belief to be rational it must be demonstrable.

<CENTER><B>Against Hume</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
At this point Logicist Epistemology parts company with Hume.
Drawing a distinction related to Popper's distinction between verifiability and falsifiability.
Even for kinds of proposition which cannot be logically demonstrated, rationality remains a relevant requirement, and can be connected with a requirement for logical consistency.
Thus an empirical generalisation, though not deducible from particular observations on which it is based, should nevertheless be logically consistent with them.
Kant's <I>Categorical Imperative</I> is an example of the relevance of rationality to moral judgements.
Even though logical judgements are not analytic, there are considerations of consistency in moral judgement which are reducible to matters of logic.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Rationality, we hold, encompasses not only those domains such as mathematics in which results are established by deduction, but also all other sphere's where factual or evaluative judgements may be expected to be consistent.
Ideally consistency may be established using formal models.
Foundationally, epistemologically, we may ask whether there are any aspects of rationality which are not thus reducible to logic, and whether we may therefore claim that the relevance of a FAn oracle or the Analytic Superbrain is to the whole of rational discourse.

The epistemological relevance of logic to engineering is of particular interest.
Prior to building a complex artefact intended to fulfill some particular purpose it is necessary to produce an overall architecture and detailed design which prescribes what it is that will be fabricated.
Before embarking on the fabrication we wish to know that the prescribed artefact will fullfil the purpose for which it is intended.
We therefore have a problem of knowledge which it is now routine to address by the construction and analysis of mathematical models.

Hume tells us that demonstrative proof is possible only for claims which express a relationship between ideas (what we might now call analytic or logical truths), and not for any matters of fact or value judgements.
In this we concur.
He further seems to believe that in other beliefs rationality plays no role, that the we draw conclusions about matters of fact (e.g. general scientific laws) purely from habit.
From this we demur.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Deductive reasoning about the consistency of our views permits rationality to constrain our beliefs about matters of fact and value judgements.
Logical analysis of sound arguments should always lead to the isolation of a set of premises from which the conclusion is deducible.
The conjunction of these premises defines a collection of models (those satisfying the premises) in which the argument is valid.
We have consistency only if the set of models is non-empty.

An important way of testing rationality is through models.

We seek to rehabilitate forms of foundationalism.
Deductive arguments are of necessity well-founded, in the sense that a proof is finite and involves a finite set of premises.
When we construct a model we have in mind a general model which encompasses some body of particular (supposed) facts.
An important element in the justification for the model is that it does entail those facts (whether or not they are indeed facts).
