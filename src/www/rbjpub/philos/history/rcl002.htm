<CENTER><B>Childhood</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Born in 1891 in Northwest Germany, Carnap was fascinated, watching his mother working on a book on her father's life, by "the magical activity of putting thought onto paper".
In 1910 they moved to Jena where he studied at the Universities of Jena and Frieberg/i.B.

<CENTER><B>Interests and Inspiration</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
As a student Carnap was interested first mainly in mathematics and philosophy, later in philosophy and physics.
He liked the decisiveness of mathematical demonstration by comparison with the endless controversies of philosophy, but his "most fruitful inspiration" came from the lectures of Frege on symbolic logic.
He preferred physics to the other empirical sciences because of its ability to make exact numerical predictions.</FONT>

As a student Carnap seems to have been influenced by detailed study of <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/k.htm#Kant">Kant</A>'s <I>Critique of Pure Reason</I>, particular by Kant's writings on the geometry of space.
His dissertation was to be in this area.

This period of Carnap's life ends with a period of military conscription during the first world war.
During this period he nevertheless found some time for his scientific and philosophical interests, and became interested in socialism and in Einstein's theory of relativity.

After the war Carnap returned to his studies.
He decided to work in philosophy and theoretical physics, dropping experimental physics, and completed his doctoral dissertation on the philosophical foundations of geometry.
</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE=2>
He then continued his work in logic and philosophy under the inspiration of Frege and Russell, working on early versions of his books <I>Abriss der Logistik</I> a logic text based on <I>Principia Mathematica</I> and <I>Der Logische Aufbau der Welt</I>, The Logical Structure of the World.

Frege had the strongest influence on Carnap in the fields of logic and semantics.
Carnap studied <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/f.htm#Frege1893"><I>Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetic</I></A> in 1920.
From Frege he learned carefulness and clarity in the analysis of concepts and expressions, the distinction between syntax and semantics, and between sense and denotation.
He also learned that knowledge in mathematics has essentially the same nature as knowledge in logic (which view was later to be made more "radical and precise" chiefly through the influence of Wittgenstein).

In general philosophical thinking Carnap learned most from Bertrand Russell.
In 1921 he read <I>Our knowledge of the external world</I>.
This made "an especially vivid impression" on him because it formulated clearly a view (on the logico-analytic method of philosophy) which Carnap <I>already implicitly held</I>.
He quotes an appeal by Russell<A TARGET="_top" HREF="brq001.htm#Q007"><IMG SRC="../../../rbjgifs/quotesm.gif" ALT="quote" BORDER=0 ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=15></A> which he felt "had been directed to me personally".
Carnap then undertook intensive study of Russell's books on the theory of knowledge and the methodology of science.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT SIZE=2><CENTER><B>analytic method</B></CENTER>
This work began with attempts to analyse concepts from ordinary language, with the intention of ultimately defining these concepts in terms of sensory phenomena (a color at a position in the visual field).
This was guided by psychological facts but intended only as a "rational reconstruction" giving the same results.
The logic of relations in <I>Principia Mathematica</I> was considered by Carnap a suitable tool for this kind of task.
The influence of Gestalt psychology later caused a shift to a basis in the elements of experience rather than in sense-data.
<CENTER><B>phenomenal v. physical</B></CENTER>
Though the concepts in <I>Aufbau</I> were constructed on a phenomenalistic basis (influenced by "some radical empiricist or positivist german philosophers of the end of the 19th century") Carnap also indicated the possibility of using a physicalistic basis

<CENTER><B>principle of tolerance</B></CENTER>
In discussing these ideas, both with friends and in the book, Carnap found himself moving with ease between different kinds of language, e.g. realistic, idealistic, nominalistic.
Only later did he recognise clearly that his way of thinking was neutral with respect to the "traditional controversies", realism/idealism, nominalism/platonism, materialism/spiritualism et.al.
This neutral attitude remained with Carnap throughout his life and was formulated by his <I>principle of tolerance</I> in <I>Logical Syntax</I> <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/c.htm#Carnap34">[Carnap34]</A></I>.
<CENTER><B>publication</B></CENTER>
A first version of <I>Der Logische Aufbau der Welt</I> was complete in 1925, but was revised again before publication in 1928 <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/c.htm#Carnap28">[Carnap28]</A></I>.
Carnap never returned to the program envisaged by the book, partly because he came later to prefer a physicalistic rather than phenomenalistic basis.

First contact with the philosophers at Warsaw came when Tarski was invited to Vienna in February 1930 and lectured on metamathematics, which introduced Carnap to the use of formal metalanguages.
Discussions with Tarski and with G&ouml;del helped Carnap towards his theory of logical syntax.
He disagreed with Tarski on the analytic/synthetic dichotomy, which Tarski thought a matter of degree.
Carnap visited Warsaw in November 1930, giving lectures to the Warsaw Philosophical Society, talking privately to Tarski, Lesniewski and Kortarbinski, who were all involved in work on semantics.

At this time Popper was also in Vienna, but was not a member of the circle.
Carnap read the manuscript of <I>Logik der Forschung</I> and had discussions with Popper in the summer of 1932.
Though Popper had "similar" attitudes to the circle, Carnap felt that he overemphasised the differences.
Popper criticised "the positivists" and antagonised some of the members of the circle.
