A proposition is <EM>Logically Necessary</EM>, <EM>necessarily true</EM> or just plain <EM>necessary</EM> if the statement could not possibly be false.
If it is true in all <EM>possible worlds</EM>.
The concept depends therefore upon what we consider to be a possible world.
The narrower our conception of <EM>possible world</EM>, the broader our conception of necessity.
<P>
The adjective <EM>logical</EM> is used to distinguish the concept from other kinds of necessity such as those induced by laws of nature or courts of law.
<P>
Even confining our considerations to <EM>logical</EM> necessity there are several alternative views on how tightly this concept should be defined.
We here consider three alternatives differing in how tolerant they are of failures of reference:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="#Free">Free Logical Necessity</A>
<DD>In which a necessary statements must be true in all domains of discourse (<A HREF="005.htm">example</A> 4 only).
<DT><A HREF="#Abstract">Abstract Logical Necessity</A>
<DD>In which a failure of concrete reference will disqualify a candidate (<A HREF="005.htm">example</A>s 3 and 4).
<DT><A HREF="#Broad">Broad Logical Necessity</A>
<DD>In which necessary truths containing references to material entities are admitted (<A HREF="005.htm">example</A>s 2,3 and 4).

This term, by analogy with <I>free logic</I> is necessity without any ontological commitment.

A statement is <EM>necessarily true</EM> (or again <EM>necessary</EM> simpliciter) if it is true in every <EM>possible</EM> world.
How much help is to be found in this definition is moot.
It does show the relationship between necessity and possibility tacity invoked in the previous paragraph, viz that these concepts are inter-definable.
<P>
A statement is <EM>necessarily false</EM> (or <EM>self contradictory</EM>) if it is false in every possible world.
<P>
If a statement is true in some, but false in other possible worlds then it is <EM>contingent</EM>.
It is intended that all statements of a certain class are either necessary or contingent.

<CENTER><B>First Order Validity</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
In this most strict sense of necessity a possible world is similar to an <EM>interpretation</EM> in first order logic, and necessity is essentially first order validity.
It takes the most radical view of the dictum that logic is devoid of subject matter, a statement being necessary only if true independently of the meaning of the "non-logical" symbols employed in it.
<P>
The term "free" is used because the notion of necessity here comes closest to that of validity in a free first order logic.

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#ddffff"><FONT SIZE=4><B>
Abstract entities seem to live in a hinterland between necessity and contingency.
Abstract Necessity recognises that they are discretionary rather than contingent, and provides that kind of necessity which can be attributed to the truths of arithmetic.

<CENTER><B>Abstract Necessity</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
With the definitions as given above for <EM>free</EM> necessity, any statement which fails in any possible world to have a truth value cannot possibly be necessary, even if is false in no possible world.
The largest class of statements which is partitioned by the necessary/contingent dichotomy is the class of statements which have a truth value in every possible world.
<P>
This requirement may be thought to be implicit in a definiton of necessity couched as a property of propositions rather than statements.
<P>
Free necessity is particularly demanding since even if no reference to any contingent object is intended, as in the case of a pure set theory, statements may be denied necessity and rendered contingent.
<P>
If we want to regard as necessary statements which make reference to abstract entities, on the grounds that their lack of any reference to the material world ensures that if true they are true in every possible world, then we have the notion which is here called <EM>abstract</EM> necessity.

<CENTER><B>Possible World v. Domain of Discourse</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Statements which are necessary in this sense suggest a gap between a <EM>possible world</EM> and a <EM>domain of discourse</EM>, which corresponds to a gap between necessity and first order validity.
The gap arises from allowing the semantics of constants which refer to abstract entities to be fixed in the semantics, in the same way as the semantics of logical constants are determined.
The semantics can be made clear by the introduction of the notion of a standard interpretation, and a revised definition of truth (simpliciter) as "true in every standard interpretation".
The population of abstract entities is seen as part of a choice of meaning (for the language) rather than as being a factor which varies through the possible worlds.

If we instantiate a general necessary truth such as a propositional tautology using a sentence which refers to some contingent entity, such as New York we get a statement which satisfies neither our definition of free nor of abstract necessity.
Broad necessity is intended to accomodate such statements.

<CENTER><B>Contingent Reference</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
With the definitions as given, certain statements which we might like to consider necessary, for example, that it either is or is not raining in New York are still excluded.
<P>
They fail to meet the criteria, since in some possible worlds, viz those in which New York does not exist, the statement mail fail to be meaningful, and hence fail to have a truth value at all.
On the other hand, we may think that propositional tautologies should be considered true even when their constituent atomic propositions turn out to be meaningless.

<CENTER><B>Broad Necessity</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The notion of broad necessity encompasses this class of propositions by disregarding any possible worlds in which the names or noun phrases in the statement have no reference.
<P>
Insisting on models providing a reference for all names is done in first order logic, so this is no extension from the view of necessity in first order logic, but for some other logics and for natural languages it is a less trivial extension.

<CENTER><B>Semantic Conditions</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
In the case of abstract entities we have produced a notion of necessity which admits the intended abstract subject matter of the language into the ontology of every possible world, provided that the abstract semantics is consistent, so that failure of necessity does not arise because of abstract ontological presuppositions.
<P>
When we extend to protecting against non-existence of concrete entities the same considerations arise.
What <I>kinds</I> of concrete entities can we presuppose?
<P>
Broad necessity admits semantics for contingent reference on exactly the same conditions, viz. that the semantics is consistent.
The effect of this is to give cause for great care in interpreting necessary truths involving concrete references.
