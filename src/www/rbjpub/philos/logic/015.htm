A key feature of logic is that it is concerned with <I>sound</I>, <I>a priori</I> arguments, viz. those in which conclusions follow <I>of necessity</I>.

Two criteria for adequacy of a definition of logic are:

<LI>that it correctly delineates the sphere in which logical methods are applicable

<CENTER><B>The Sphere of Logic</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The intention is to put forward a definition of logic which makes logic encompass all sound <I>a priori</I> reasoning.
It is my belief that the more common definitions of logic fail to do this.
In particular, we seek a defensible definition of logic within which the truths of mathematics can be seen to fall.

That philosophers derive truths by reason rather than experiment encourages many to believe that their conclusions have the force of logic, and others to deny the legitimacy of philosophical conclusions which are not analytic.

<CENTER><B>Rationalists</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Rationalist philosophers can perhaps be regarded as subscribing to the view that philosophy (sometimes in a very broad sense) derives conclusions by deductive methods and that in consequence these conclusions may be considered a part of logic.
In practice their conclusions have rarely been logical truths, and we may debate whether this is because they in fact believed philosophy to go beyond logic or because they had a defective understanding of the limits of logic (and hence of philosophy also).

<CENTER><B>Atomism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The heyday for logic in philosophy was the early decades of this century after the success of Frege and Russell in (mostly) formalising mathematics using logic.
Atomism sought to re-build philosophical doctrine in the light of the logical advances, but thought perhaps too little about the status of philosophy itself  to be credited with the identification of philosophy and logic.
Nevertheless the point that <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../history/brq001.htm#Q003">philosophy is indistinguishable from logic</A></I> is made by <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/r.htm#Russell">Bertrand Russell</A> in 1914.

<CENTER><B>Positivism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The Logical positivists did give a great deal of attention to the status of philosophy.
Like Russell before him, <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/a.htm#Ayer">A.J.Ayer</A> explicitly affirmed that <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../history/aaq001.htm#Q002">philosophy is a department of logic</A></I>.

<A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/c.htm#Carnap">Rudolf Carnap</A>'s account of the <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../../methods/fm/fm012.htm">syntactic method</A> practised by the Vienna Circle advocates the method of semantic ascent as a way of making explicit the linguistic, and hence logical, character of philosophical propositions which might otherwise appear to be concerned with matters of fact.

<CENTER><B>Origins of Analytic Philosophy</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The modern origin of "analytic" philosophy is popularly located with Russell and Moore.
<BR>
Russell's analytic bent was to <I>formal logical</I> analysis, and this tendency leads us first to logical atomism and then to logical positivism, neither of which provides a satisfactory account of how logic can subsume philosophy.
<BR>
Moore was a <I>common sense</I> philosopher, and this tendency, mediated by Ludwig Wittgenstein had an impact on the practice of philosophy far greater than that of atomism or positivism.
The kind of analysis involved here, the analysis of ordinary language, is very far removed from logical analysis, and exposes (as it were, by caricature) a weakness in the positivist account of analysis.

<CENTER><B>Analysis of Language</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Carnap believed that since an analytic truth owes its truth to features of language it must be equivalent to a statement about language, and possibly also that true statements about language are likely to be analytic.
Both of these views are incorrect, and it is this which has enabled philosophers to engage in analysis of language without confining themselves to logic.
<BR>
Statements <I>about</I> languages are only potentially analytic if the language in question has been formally defined, so that the statements can be logically derived from the definitions.
In the case of natural languages it is doubtful that formal definitions, or even precise informal ones, will ever be available.
