This holistic dimension of the Global SuperBrain may be considered as a thought experiment which may help us to get a handle on how the human race plots its course into the future.

<CENTER><B>Biosphere as Superorganism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The first stage in the thought experiment is to consider the earth's biosphere as if it were a single superorganism.
(It doesn't matter whether its <I>really</I> a superorganism, whatever that means).

<FONT SIZE=2>
Next we consider what the brain of this superorganism is.
This is what we are going to talk of as "the global superbrain".
Its not crucial for present purposes exactly where the boundary lies; lets include the brains of all the humans on the planet, all the communications media which may help these brains to work together, and all the artifical brains we have built.
So this includes the internet and all the computers hanging off it.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Next we think of the earth as a whole, superbrain, superorganism and the rest of planet earth which is its home, as a control system.
Its worth talking through whether this makes sense and what purpose it may serve.

Information is fed from the system via the sensors to the controller which then influences the system using the effectors so as to bring the system closer to the ideal state.
This circular flow of information which attempts to eliminate divergence from the ideal is called a <I>negative feedback</I> loop.

When the temperature looks too low, the heat is turned on, which brings the temperature closer to the target.
When its too high, the heat is turned off, and the temperature should fall.
