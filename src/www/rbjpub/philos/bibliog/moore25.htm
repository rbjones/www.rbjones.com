<TABLE CLASS=bib><TR><TD>
<DL>
<DT><B>I. Belief in certain truisms</B>
<DD>
<DL>
<DT><B>(1)</B> list of truisms which Moore <I>knows</I> with certainty to be true:
<DD>My body has existed continuously on or near the earth,
at various distances from or in contact with other existing things, including other living human beings... (lots more)
<DT><B>(2)</B> single truism, also known with certainty:
<DD>very many other people know similar things about themselves as the truisms mentioned under (1)
</DL>
Moore holds these truisms to be <I>wholly</I> true under their <I>usual</I> interpretations.
<BR>
The distinction is drawn between <I>understanding the meaning</I> of an expression and <I>being able to give a correct analysis</I> of it.
<BR>
Philosophers who disagree with these view are divided into two groups:
<DL>
<DT><B>A.</B> Those who hold that no proposition from some of the classes in (2) is wholly true 
<DD>
The following four points are offered in refutation of these philosophers
<DL>
<DT><B>(a)</B> the denial of the truisms entails the non-existence of philosophers
<DD> 
<DT><B>(b)</B> all philosophers who have denied the truisms have also held other beliefs incompatible with their denial
<DD>e.g. by alluding to the existence of other philosophers
<DT><B>(c)</B> some philosophers have held that a contradiction can be derived from the truisms
<DD>but this cannot be the case, since they are true
<DT><B>(d)</B> the supposition that these truisms are false is not in itself contradictory, it is simply false (since they are true)
<DD>
</DL>
<DT><B>B.</B> Those who hold that no proposition from some of the classes in (2) is known with certainty to be true
<DD>
</DL>
<DT><B>II. Independence of Physical Facts from Mental Facts</B>
<DD>By way of clarification, there are three different kinds of "mental facts":
<DL>
<DT><B>(a)</B> Facts which are like: "I am conscious now" and "I am seeing something now" in one of the two following respects:
<DD>
<DL>
<DT><B>(alpha)</B> in being the fact that some particular individual was conscious at some particular time
<DD>
<DT><B>(beta)</B> in being a fact which involves or entails a fact of type (alpha), in the way that <I>seeing something</I> is a specific way of <I>being conscious</I>.
<DD>
</DL>
<DT><B>(b)</B> experiences, e.g. the experience of "being conscious now"
<DD>Moore doubts that there are such facts, but he admits that experiences, if there were any, would be mental facts.
<DT><B>(c)</B> timeless experiences, e.g. being <I>timelessly</I> conscious
<DD>Ditto.
</DL>
Finally there is a fourth kind of mental fact which asserts of any of the three kinds of mental fact mentioned above that there are mental facts of that kind.
A kind of mental metafact.
<DL>
<DT><B>A.</B>There is no good reason to suppose that <I>every</I> physical fact is <I>logically</I> dependent on some mental fact.
<DD>After explaining "logical dependence" the Moore's argument comes down to another bald assertion that the previously mentioned truisms are true (without condition).
<DT><B>B.</B>There is no good reason to suppose that <I>every</I> physical fact is <I>causally</I> dependent on some mental fact.
<DD>Because, for example, there is no good reason to suppose that the fact that the earth has existed for many years past is causally dependent on any mental fact.
</DL>

<DT><B>III. No good reason for belief in God or in an afterlife</B>
<DD>
<DT><B>IV. Doubt about correctness of analyses of truisms</B>
<DD>Moore attempts an analysis in terms of sense data, having some difficulty in pinning down exactly what we know when we experience a sense datum.
He considers the following three possibilities:
<DL>
<DT><B>(1)</B> the sense datum itself is part of the surface of the human hand
<DD>
<DT><B>(2)</B> there is some relation R such that the surface of the hand has relation R to the sense datum
<DD>
<DT><B>(3)</B> a set of hypotheticals of the form "if condition then I would perceive a sense datum related to <I>this</I> sense datum in a particular way" (where the condition and the particular relation vary, but the reference to the <I>this</I> sense datum is fixed.)
<DD>
</DL>
<DT><B>V. That there are other "selves" is true, but incorrectly analysed</B>
<DD>
</DL>
