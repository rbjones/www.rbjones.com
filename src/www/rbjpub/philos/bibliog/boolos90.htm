<H1>The Standard of Equality of Numbers</H1>
<H3>by <A HREF="b.htm#Boolos">George Boolos</A></H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
A contribution to the case against Logicism.
<P>
The following notes are not intended as a general review of the paper.
It is an analysis of the arguments presented in the paper which may bear upon either the claim that <EM> Mathematics is reducible to logic</EM> or that <EM>Mathematics is Analytic</EM>.
<P>

There are, I believe, two main themes in this paper:

<UL>
<LI>First, the refutation of attempts to <EM>prove</EM> the existence of infinite collections.
<LI>Second, an exposition of the merits of Frege's derivation of arithmetic from a principle dubbed "Hume's Thesis".
</UL>
The importance of the first theme lies in its relevance to the claims of logicism.
<P>
I don't really understand why Boolos attaches as much importance to the role of "Hume's" thesis as he does.
<P>
The gross structure of the paper is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>A discussion of Dedekind's proof that "there are infinite systems"
<LI>A refutation of the reducibility of arithmetic to second order logic.
<LI>Hume's Principle.
</UL>
