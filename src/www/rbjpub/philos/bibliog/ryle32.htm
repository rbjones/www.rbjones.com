<H1>Systematically Misleading Expressions</H1>
<H3>by <A HREF="r.htm#Ryle">Gilbert Ryle</A></H3>

<P>
<TABLE CLASS=bib><TR><TD>
This is the most influential paper written by Ryle in his early "occamising" phase.
Relevant influences on Ryle at this time are:
<OL>
<LI>The idea, from Russell and Wittgenstein, that a sentence has a logical form which may not be the same as its apparent syntactic structure.
<LI>The specific examples of this addressed by Russell's theory of descriptions, in which a method is shown for explaining the "true" logical structure of sentences containing a definite description which may fail to refer.
<LI>Russell's evolving ontological attitude, which moved from almost Meinongian liberality to various doctrines (incomplete symbols, logical constructions) intended to minimise ontological commitments.
<LI>Probably something from Ryle's dealings with Wittgenstein, who was then in transition from his earlier to his later philosophical positions.
</OL>
Ryle took the view that there are a wide variety of idioms in use which incorrectly appear to make ontological commitments which disappear when the true logical form underlying the idiom is revealed.
These idioms he described as <I>systematically misleading expressions</I>.
It is the main purpose of his paper (and of philosophy) to identify these misleading expressions and, by revealing their true logical form, eliminate the apparent ontological commitments.
<P>
He identifies four kinds of "systematically misleading expressions":
<DL>
<DT><B>I. Quasi-ontological Statements</B>
<DD>
<DT><B>II. Statements seemingly about Universals, or quasi-Platonic statements</B>
<DT><B>III. Descriptive expressions and quasi-descriptions</B>
<DD>
<DT><B>IV. Systematically misleading quasi-referential "the"- phrases</B> 
<DL>
<DT><B>1. the King of France</B> the use of definite descriptions in contexts where, even if there is nothing satisfying the description the use in context is meaningful, e.g. "Poincar&eacute; is not the King of France". 
<DD>
<DT><B>2. the labour party</B> 
<DD>
<DT><B>3. the whale</B> 
<DD>
