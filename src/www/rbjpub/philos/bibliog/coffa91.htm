<H3>Introduction</H3>
</CENTER>
The "primary topic" of this book is the philosophy of the Vienna Circle in the decade from 1925 to 1935.
The topic is addressed in the second of the two parts of the book, the first of which sets the context by describing the progression of the "semantic tradition" through the nineteenth and into the twentieth centuries.
<P>
The introduction puts this account of the semantic tradition in context.
The author discerns three major currents in epistemology in the nineteenth century, distinguished by their attitudes toward the <EM>a priori</EM>.
These traditions were:
<DL>
<DT>positivism
<DD>which denied that there were any <EM>a priori</EM> truths
<DT>Kantianism
<DD>which explained the <EM>a priori</EM> using "pure intuition" (the Copernican turn)
<DT>the semantic tradition
<DD>which is characterised by a particular concern for meaning, and which accepts the a priori while rejecting Kant's explanation of how a priori knowledge is possible.

<P>
In his introduction Coffa says that Carnap is not so hot on the underlying
philosophical issues as he is on "formal level philosophical issues", and that
though LSL exhibits "a certain attitude towards semantic matters" he fails to
articulate that attitude clearly.
<P>
I find myself disagreeing with Coffa about the substance and merits of Carnap's
position here, even though I have not read LSL!
<P>
I sketch here what I can remember of my disagreement (having failed to take
notes while reading).
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Factuality of Meaning</H4></CENTER>
The most important point I recall is the one about "factuality of meaning" which
gives the title its meaning.
Here Coffa more or less openly insists that Carnap must accept factuality of
meaning "at the second level" without there appearing to be any evidence that
he does.
I think by this Coffa means that though meaning at the level of object
languages is conventional, in order to be able to give rules prescribing such
conventions one must have a non-conventional semantics for the language in
which these prescriptions are made.
<P>
I doubt that this is something which Carnap would have accepted, and it is not
something which I myself accept.
There is a problem of semantic regress which does require an answer, but I
would not myself answer this problem with the supposition that there is a
language somewhere whose semantics is determined absolutely rather than being a
matter of convention, which is the best sense I can make of Coffa's "factuality
of meaning" thesis.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>A Point About Syntax</H4></CENTER>
There is a discussion in this chapter of Carnap's claim that empirical
questions could be dealt with syntactically.
At least I think its in this chapter, but I can't find it right now.
Anyway Carnap appears to say that it is not just questions of L-truth (logical
truth) which can be settled syntactically (i.e. formal proof) but also of
P-truth (synthetic claims).
This Coffa rejects.
<P>
There is a question here about what Carnap meant.
To me it seems obvious that he is saying that once a physical theory has been
formalised, the consequences of the theory can be obtained syntactically.
i.e. once the P-rules have been laid down, P-truth becomes a matter of syntax.
He is not saying that you can decide syntactically whether the theory is true,
i.e. he is not saying either that the P-rules themselves can be decided
syntactically, or even that the P-rules are a matter of convention.
<P>
<CENTER><H4>The Principle of Tolerance</H4></CENTER>
I think Coffa's objections to this principle largely follow from his belief in the
"factuality of meaning".
Another source is Coffa's inability to credit that certain philosophical
positions held by Carnap could be simply "proposals" rather than beliefs about
matters of fact.
I however, in relation to the examples raised by Coffa, did not have a problem
regarding these as being appropriate for consideration as proposals.
<P>
For example:
<blockquote>
"When he explained that the problem of foundations and other philosophical
questions were 'at bottom (im Grund) syntactical , although the ordinary
formulation of the problems often disguises their character' (LSL p331), Carnap
was inadvertently expressing the non-conventional character of his convictions" 
</blockquote>
I don't myself accept this.
Carnap has adopted a very general position about the character of philosophy,
but does not feel obliged to reflect this position in a wholesale rewording of
talk about philosophical problems.
This is analogous to his position on pseudo-object sentences.
Its not quite the same because in his explanation of how pseudo-object
sentences are to be rendered in the formal mode as talk about syntax, he does
not talk about the possibility that they be rendered as proposals about
conventions or methods rather than as statements about syntax.
However, if challenged I think it likely that he would claim that his
assertions about the talk about foundations are themselves also proposals, or
are covered by his previous proposal about the nature of philosophy.
<P>
It is true that Carnap seems sometimes more dogmatic about these things than is
strictly consistent with making a proposal, but again, if challenged I think he
would moderate his dogmatism rather than his principle of tolerance.
