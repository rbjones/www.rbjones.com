The book continues the case <EM>against</EM> Turing computable AI and <EM>for</EM> some thesis along the lines that consciousness is to be explained through quantum effects in the brain which was also the topic of his previous book <A HREF="p.htm#Penrose90"><EM>The Emperor's New Mind</EM></A>.
<P>
Though on the same basic theme 
<P>
The book is divided in to two parts.
The <A HREF="#FirstPart">first part</A> makes the case that consciousness cannot be caused or simulated by Turing Machine computation.
The <A HREF="#SecondPart">second part</A> seeks scientific explanations of consciousness through quantum mechanics.

	<DT>The <EM>A, B, C, D</EM> of computation and conscious thinking.
	<DD>Four viewpoints are identified as follows:
		<DL>
		<DT>A
		<DD>All thinking is computation; in particular, feelings of conscious awareness are evoked by the carrying out of appropriate computations
		<DT>B
		<DD>Awareness is a feature of the brain's physical action; and whereas any physical action can be simluated computationally, computational simulation cannot by itself evoke awareness.
		<DT>C
		<DD>Appropriate physical action of the brain evokes awareness, but the physical action cannot even be simluated computationally.
		<DT>D
		<DD>Awareness cannot be explained by physical, computational, or any other scientific terms.
