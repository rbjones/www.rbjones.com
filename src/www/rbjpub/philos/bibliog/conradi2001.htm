<H3>Introductory Remarks</H3>
<P>
I begin to write these notes as I am about half way through my second reading of this book.
It says something that I am reading it a second time, I can think of only one other biography which I have read twice, that of Bertrand Russell (his autobiography actually).
Russell's biography was certainly very interesting to me, because I have similar philosophical interests and a great deal of respect for Russell's intellectual integrity.
<p>
As a person rather than an intellectual, Russell was not so impressive.
He had a loveless and solitary childhood with inevitable consequences for his emotional depth in maturity.
<p>
Iris Murdoch, on the other hand was blessed with a stable, loving family and positive educational environments in which she grew confident and secure both intellectually and emotionally.
<p>

<p>


<A NAME="PartOne"></A>
<H2>Part One - Innocence</H2>
What is seems most remarkable to me about the Iris which emerged from this age of innocence is the very solid sense of emotional security which made it possible for her, during the next stage of her life, for Conradi that of "innocence lost", to explore so fearlessly the experience of love and power in personal relationships.
<P>
I cannot help but wonder what it was which gave her the self confidence, the sense even of emotional indestructibility, and the will to engage so many of those she met in deep and emotional relationships.
<P>
Among the obvious factors are, loving and devoted parents, who nevertheless sent away their child to the best schools, rather than holding her close.
The two schools she attended, the special teachers at those schools, and perhaps even the special mix of children whose parents chose to send their children to the schools.
Presumably none of this suffices to create an Iris, or we would have seen more of them, presumably the genes play a part, and how are we to know how large this part is?
A part in forming her character, and in shaping her contours, mere good looks an essential ingredient.
<P>
Tempting though it may be to wonder whether any of these ingredients were more crucial than the other, it is doubtful that we could ever know.

<A NAME="PartTwo"></A>
<H2>Part Two - Innocence Lost</H2>
<P>
This period Conradi talks of as a period of innocence lost, but he does not appear to note any sense of purpose or any special role for this phase in the architecture of her life.
There are hints elsewhere that others were quicker to draw conclusions (throwaway remarks by her friend "Morris" in the IRIS film come to mind).
<P>
The picture of a woman sleeping her way to the top gives us an extreme model of how women can turn sexual exploitation on its head.
Iris seems to have used emotional relationships (which might or not also be sexual) as a primary route to the enlightenments which she sought to deploy as novelist and philosopher.
There is a suggestion of systematic duplicity here which is harder to dislodge than in the simpler picture of a sexual adventuress.
One might honestly trade sexual favours for financial or other advantage, but true love brooks no compromise. 
<P>
After a first reading the suspicion that the panoply of relationships during this phase of Iris's life were entered into to just that extent which would fuel future writing without risking a creatively lethal entrapment.
<P>
Here are some suggestions on how the relationships most prominent in Conradi's biography of this period can be read as systematically ambiguous.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Frank Thompson - seems to have become more important to Iris the more distant and unreachable, seems to have appeared more important in later life than ever he had been in the flesh.
Once away, he offered love by correspondence, once dead, the experience of grief and adulation.
On my first reading of the biography I entertained the possibility that Iris's main period of emotional promiscuity was a reaction to her having lost her true love in this terrible way, and to come to a more definite view on this possibility was one of my aims in the rereading.
The idea no longer has any shred of credibility for me.
There never was, it seems to me, a possibility of that kind of romantic relationship dominating her life.
The ruthless imperative was a life as a novelist, and such a relationship could not have served that purpose for Iris.
When later Iris chose a lifetime partner it would be clear (it seems to me) that the partnership was an instrument of the ambition not a supreme end in itself.
</LI>
<LI>Tommy Balogh - why did Iris fall in love with this man?
Perhaps, for the experience of being hopelessly in love with a man who would ultimately spurn her.
For the experience of being devastated by love.
</LI>
<LI>David Hicks - Iris was engaged to be married to David Hicks for some time, but so far as this relationship is presented by Conradi it seems unbelievable that they were serious in the matter.
Had Iris allowed herself to become engaged for the sake of being jilted?</LI>
<LI>Franz Steiner - this is one of a number of close relationships which seem to have been for Iris a way of learning the most from someone who she respected intellectually.
In this case however, the intimacy of the relationship seems to have gone beyond what might be plausible on those grounds alone.
Stenier was himself emotionally much more vulnerable than Iris and clearly for him this relationship became his whole life.
It was to be expected that unless they did become married he would have been ultimately devastated as the relationship declined, and yet this could not have been the kind of permanent relationship which Iris would have sought (not at all like the relationship with John Bayley).
It was a relationship in which Iris lent support to a great man, not one to support her own career.
However, Steiner was physically infirm, and what the relationship became for Iris ultimately was a bereavement as profound as her attachment to Steiner has been.
Did Iris allow herself to become so close <i>in the expectation of bereavement</i>?
Do I doubt the sincerity of her attachment or of her grief?
Well, no.
But the attachment of a woman as emotionally secure as Iris, with other ongoing relationships is not so existntially crucial are it might have been for another woman.
The grief of a woman for whom this relationship was a detail on a larger canvas could not be the same as that of a woman whose entire thrust of life has been cut adrift.
<LI>Elias Canetti - was for Iris, it appears, both a intellectually and a sexually dominating force.
We know that Iris was interested in the interplay between love and power, and in her relationship with Canetti appears to have sought first hand knowledge of a relationship with a dominating power.
Despite this dominated relationship with Canetti's, Iris retained her independence.
Eventually their relationship was curtailed to the extent necessary for relationship with Bayley to provide Iris with the stability she needed for her creative writing.

<blockquote>
"Here is a programme for her own fiction: to restore poetry, mystery, nightmare, terror, opacity to modern fiction, and also to criticise Sartre's 'dramatic, solipsistic, romantic and anti-social exaltation of the individual': 'We are not yet resigned to absurdity, and our only hope lies in not becoming resigned.'"
</blockquote>

<H4>Ch.12 - Franz Baermann Steiner</H4>

&sect;9 -
<blockquote>
"Though 'in such pain as never before', the urge to record little
things, to notate the psychopathology of grief, remained."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"'The horror of feeling indestructible.  I can bear all this grief and
more without breaking.'"

&sect;9 -
<blockquote>
"So far from her head being turned, she was 'nauseated by the stream of imbecile praise for <i>The Bell</i>'.  Three aspects of this response invite comment.  Firstly, the great success of <i>The Bell</i> dispirited her.  Secondly, she badly wanted to improve as a writer. Lastly, she wanted to be <i>attacked</i> 'in the right way'.  And she cast about for the right person to attack her."

<blockquote>
"A friend noted in 1978 that in Iris 'a highly organised analytical mind [was] at war with her warm irrational Irish heart'."
</blockquote>

I was a bit shocked to read this, retaining, more than three quarters through my second reading of this biography, a conception of Iris as a disorderly antithesis of the analytic!

<H2>Concluding Remarks</H2></A>
<P>
<h4>The Life Plan</h4>
After my first reading of this book I was left with the feeling that the architecture of the life and work of Iris was a more deliberate whole than appeared to have been suggested by Conradi.
<P>
Her entire life, from as early as one can conceive of her having a life plan, seems to have been devoted to her art.
She appears already as an undergraduate to have expected to be an author, and to have expected that she would marry at about the age of 35.
The wild and emotionally promiscuous period which preceded her marriage certainly looks like a bit of field research for her intended career as a novelist.
<P>
I'm going to spin this yarn a bit further and then leave it with you.
<P>
The plan comes as two phases, the field research, in which love and power is the primary topic, and which is of necessity highly turbulent (and thus perhaps not so conducive to steady writing, but OK for plenty of practice in writing through journals, correspondence and essays at the novels which would follow), followed by a stable domestic relationship persisting throught a productive career.
<P>
The field research phase is tricky, for a woman who want to know what it is to be in love with powerful and dominating men is at risk of finding the experience overwhelming.
A woman risks becoming ensnared at the expence of her freedom to be a creative force. 
Iris appears to have had a strategy to deal with this risk, and it rested substantially on dissimulation.
This idea came to me not from the autobiography, but from my subsequent reading of her nove "The Bell", in which a principle female character deals with a dominating partner by simple unreliability.
When she parted his presence, she simply shed like an old skin whatever impositions he might have wished her to live with.
She might bend to his will in his presence, and yet her acquiescence would prove ineffectual in the sequel.
<P>
In the light of her expectation of marriage at 35 and her desire to be a novellist, the sincerity of the relationships which she entered into during the period before her marriage may be doubted.
Let me run through some of the relationships which get more space in Conradi's biography, commenting both on their value to the prospective novelist, and also their inappropriateness.
<p>
The relationship with Frank Thompson was a puzzle to me on my first reading, because it seemed so insubstantial when they were together, grew more important once they were separated, and on to yet greater apparent importance when that separation had been made permanent by his death.
So long as there was nothing in their way, taking that kind of relationship seriously could only interfere with the breadth and character of the experience which she sought for her work.
