Behold the mighty dinosaur,<BR>
Famous in prehistoric lore.<BR>
Not only for his power and strength<BR>
But for his intellectual length.<BR>
You will observe by these remains<BR>
The creature had two sets of brains -<BR>
One in his head (the usual place),<BR>
The other in his spinal base.<BR>
Thus he could reason "A priori"<BR>
As well as "A posteriori."<BR>
No problem bothered him a bit<BR>
He made both head and tail of it....<BR>
If something slipped his forward mind<BR>
'Twas rescued by the one behind.<BR>
And if in error he was caught<BR>
He had a saving afterthought.<BR>
As he thought twice before he spoke<BR>
he had no judgement to revoke.<BR>
Thus he could think without congestion<BR>
Upon both sides of every question....<BR>
