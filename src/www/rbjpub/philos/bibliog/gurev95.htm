This article, rendered as a dialogue between "Quisani" and the author, is presented in the following sections:
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5 CLASS=bib>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD></TD><TD>(untitled introduction)</TD>
<TD>Quisani enquires about the relevance of constructivism to computer sceince.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>1</TD><TD>Paradoxes and the Related Foundational Crisis</TD>
<TD>Platonism is introduced and blamed for the antinomies in informal set theory.
The significance of these matters for the foundations of mathematics is discussed.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>2</TD><TD>Constructivism</TD>
<TD>Constructivism is introduced, its (lack of) impact touched upon.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>3</TD><TD>Good Things About Constructivism</TD>
<TD>Five benign effects are attributed to constructivism, falling short of the truth of any part of its critique of classical mathematics.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>4</TD><TD>Computer Proofs vs. Proofs by Hand</TD>
<TD>Mainly about proofs of programs arising from constructive existence proofs.
Touching upon the "four colour problem" kind of computer proof.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>5</TD><TD>Critique of Constructivism</TD>
<TD>Constructivism is criticised, first because of the value of the non-constructive methods which it abjures,
and secondly because the concern for effectiveness did not embrace the study of feasibility.</TD></TR>
