A full understanding of Hume's <CITE>Enquiry into Human Understanding</CITE> depends upon viewing the work from several different perspectives.
<OL>
<LI>
It is desirable to get a good grip on what Hume's own view of his work, what he was trying to do, what he intended to convey by his words, and what he though was important in the work
<LI>
Present day views on the meaning and significance of the work are of course of interest.
<LI>
Any understanding of a philosopher's work must take place in the context of our own framework of philosophical beliefs.
</OL>
The Enquiry may be thought of as having the following gross structure:
<UL>
<LI><!A HREF = "echua11.htm">Motivation and Preliminaries</A> (Sections I to III)
<LI><A HREF = "echua12.htm">Sceptical Doubts and Their Resolution</A>(Sections IV and V)
<LI><!A HREF = "echua13.htm">Further Elaboration and Illustration</A> (Sections VI to XII)
</UL>

Hume's most profound and important contribution is to be found the core sections in which his sceptical doubts are expressed and resolved.
