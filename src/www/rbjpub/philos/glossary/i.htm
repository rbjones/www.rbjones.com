<DD>a kind of <A HREF="p.htm#Polymorphism" CLASS=gloref>polymorphism</A> found in the <A HREF="t.htm#TypeSystem" CLASS=gloref>type system</A>s of object oriented programming languages in which some <A HREF="t.htm#Type" CLASS=gloref>type</A>s are included in others.

<A NAME="Induction"> </A>
<DT><EM CLASS=glotitle>induction</EM>
<DL>
<DT>(mathematical)
<DD>a method of proving a general truth affirming that every one of a set of mathematical objects (e.g. the natural numbers) has a certain property (e.g. has exactly one prime factorisation).
The method depends upon their being a systematic way of constructing all the elements of the set by starting with one of a finite set of basis elements and repeatedly applying a finite number of constructions (for the natural numbers the basis is the number 0, and the method of construction is addition of 1).
An inductive proof then consists of a proof that the basis elements each have the required property and a proof that the construction, when applied to elements having the property, will yield an element also having the property.
Mathematical induction is in fact a kind of <A HREF="d.htm#Deduction" CLASS=gloref>deduction</A>.
It is also called <I>structural</I> induction.
<DT>(scientific)
<DD>scientific induction is the process of concluding <A HREF="e.htm#Empirical" CLASS=gloref>empirical</A> <A HREF="g.htm#Generalisation" CLASS=gloref>generalisation</A>s from particular instances, where this is not <A HREF="d.htm#DeductivelySound" CLASS=gloref>deductively sound</A> because not all possible instances are premises
