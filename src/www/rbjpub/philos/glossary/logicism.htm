<P>
First of all it has to be noted, that if a term in the
German language ends with "...zismus" it usually indicates
an exaggeration with a negative connotation. According to
my knowledge the term "Logizismus" has its origins in the theory
of knowledge, especially in the 19th and early 20th  century
German discussion on psychologism. It was used by Wilhelm
Wundt ("Psychologismus und Logizismus", in <EM>Kleine Schriften</EM>,
vol. 1, 1910, 511sq.) writing against a reduction of the
non-logical to the purely logical. He was especially against a
logicism in psychology (ibid., 549--582). The term was also
used by Theodor Ziehen (<EM>Lehrbuch der Logik</EM>, 1920,
172sq.) to characterize a logical movement opposed to
psychologistic, sensualistic and inductive trends, referring
especially to Bolzano, Husserl, Brentano and Meinong.
According to Ziehen "logicism" indicates directions which
grant the logical an independent existence. On p. 173,
footnote, he gives a history of the term "Logizismus",
missing, however, Wundt's use of 1910. According to
Ziehen L. Busse used the term "Logismus" for Edmund
Husserl's anti-psychologistic logic in a paper of 1903
(<EM>Zeitschrift fuer Psychologie und Physiologie der
Sinnesorgane</EM> 33 (1903), 153). Busse changed the
term to "Logizismus" in 1914 (<EM>Zum gegewaertigen Standpunkt
der Erkenntnistheorie</EM>, Wiesbaden 1914, 33), which is clearly
after Wundt. Ziehen additionally refers to a paper by K.
Groos in <EM>Zeitschrift fuer Psychologie</EM> 62 (1912), 271. 
<P>
In the modern sense "logicism" seems to be introduced by
Rudolf Carnap only in 1931 (<EM>Die logizistische
Grundlegung der Mathematik</EM>, Erkenntnis 2 (1931), 91--105)
<A HREF="../bibliog/c.htm#Carnap31"><EM>[Carnap31]</EM></A>.
<P>     
The following observations concerning the English use
might be of interest. Joergen Joergensen speaks in his 1931 <EM>A
Treatise of Formal Logic</EM> (vol. 1, p. 193) of the "'logicising' 
of mathematics" with reference to Russell's <A HREF="../bibliog/r.htm#Russell19"><EM>Introduction to
Mathematical Philosophy</EM></A> of 1919 (p. 6sq.). The styles of the
quotation and the reference seem to indicate that there were not
many uses in between. It should be noted that the German term
equivalent to "logicising" would be "logisieren" or "logificiren" 
[in modern orthography:'logifizieren'] as Benno Kerry called it in his criticism on Frege's <A HREF="../bibliog/f.htm#Frege"><I>Grundlagen der Arithmetik</I></A> (B. Kerry, Ueber Anschauung und ihre
psychische Verarbeitung. I, <I>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r
wissenschaftliche</I> Philosophie 9 (1885), 433--493, on p. 463, note 1).
Following the
German inclination for using nouns for verbs this would lead to
"Logismus" and not to "Logizismus". This doesn't exclude the
possibility that Carnap might have been motivated by Russell's
use to form the German noun, which then, as a noun, found its
 way back to the English speaking world.
