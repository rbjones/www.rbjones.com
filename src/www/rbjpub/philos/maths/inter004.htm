<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
         The discovery by Babbage of the principles underlying the general
         purpose digital computer, long before the technology became
         available to build these computers, has become part of the popular
         culture.
<P>
         It is now a hundred years since the beginnings of modern
         mathematical logic.  Early in that development the power of the
         new logic was demonstrated by Whitehead and Russell in their epic
         mathematical tome Principia Mathematica.  In this work Whitehead
         and Russell demonstrated that the main body of mathematics then
         known could be derived within a simple formal logical system.
<P>
         This might have been the beginning of a new era in mathematics,
         but it was not.  At least probably not in the way that the authors
         might have hoped.  Like Babbage, Whitehead and Russell had ideas
         which were before their time.
<P>
         Russell's theory of types may have been the first significant
         advance in mathematical rigour not to have been taken into the
         practice of mathematics.  For Russell and Whitehead `the theory of
         types' was a way of doing ultimately rigorous mathematical proofs,
         a tool for mathematicians to be used in the development of
         mathematics.  In practice it marked an unexpected watershed in the
         development of mathematical logic.  The point at which formal
         logical systems ceased to be regarded, even by the developers of
         these systems, as tools for practical use in the development of
         mathematics.  Henceforth formal systems became the objects of
         study in a new discipline called metamathematics. Mathematics was
         henceforth, though in principle derivable in these formal systems,
         in practice developed as informally as ever.
<P>
         The purposes of Russell and Whitehead were not entirely (or even
         primarily) concerned with the pragmatics of rigorous proof.  A
         central aim of their work was to demonstrate the philosophical
         conjecture that mathematics is reducible to pure logic.  In this
         purpose also they are widely held to have failed.
<P>
         The main purpose of this essay is to discuss `the mechanisation of
         mathematics'.  The discussion is partly speculation about the
         future, intended to motivate the reader's interest in the topic.
         This speculation will be underpinned by anecdotal evidence from
         current developments, which I hope will help to give some credence
         to the speculations.  The discussion will take place in the
         context of the substantial technical advances which have taken
         place in mathematical logic over the past century.
<P>
         I hope that historians in the twenty second century will come to
         view the twentieth as the century of the development of
         mathematical logic, and the twenty first that of its effective
         exploitation.
<P>
         However, during this century, while formal logical systems have
         been sidelined as practical approaches to ordinary mathematical
         proof, they have also been undermined philosophically.  They have
         been undermined, for example, by philosophers such as Quine and
         Lakatos, who, each in his own way, appear to doubt that there is
         any fundamental distinction between the mathematical and the
         physical sciences.  The importance of logical truth is undermined
         by conventionalists who see no more than arbitrary conventions,
         and perhaps even by Wittgenstein who appeared to regard
         indubitability as incompatible with truth, though this doctrine
         may be too extreme to do much damage.
<P>
         It is my main purpose in this essay, to discuss why the
         mechanisation of mathematics, in the sense here intended, is
         possible.  It is clear in the practical use of computers for
         proving mathematical theorems and developing mathematical systems,
         that the criteria by which the truth of a conjecture is judged,
         and the means whereby it is established, differ between
         mathematics (pure or applied) and most other sciences.  The ground
         of this distinction is that mathematics is essentially abstract.
         Mathematics deals entirely with abstract entities; a mathematical
         conjecture says nothing about the material world.  Our
         understanding of such conjectures is such that we do not consider
         that a physical experiment will suffice to establish them.  For a
         conjecture in one of the physical sciences to be a substantive
         hypothesis it must say something about the physical world.  For
         such a hypothesis to say something substantive, it must say
         something which could possibly be false (which is not quite to say
         that it need be falsifiable).
