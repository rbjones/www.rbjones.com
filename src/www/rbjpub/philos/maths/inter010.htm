<H1>In Support of LOGICISM</H1>
<P>

         Foundation system may be considered as having two aspects, their
         logical content, and their ontological content.  In general these
         are not cleanly separated, this being the case only for `free'
         logics (REFERENCES).  In the case of first order this is almost a
         clean separation, the only ontological content in the logic being
         the presumption that at least one thing exists.
<P>
         Concerning the former aspect, the purely logical, there is (almost
         by definition no dispute that these aspect are properly logical,
         and that theorems derived by these means alone  (where this is
         possible) are logical truths.  Concerning the ontological aspects
         there is dispute, and this dispute provides the grounds on which
         logicism is often held to be refuted.  In the case of Principia
         Mathematica, the flagship of logicism, objections are levelled at
         the axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice.  The axiom of
         infinity is sometimes supposed to have synthetic content and hence
         to be essentially empirical in nature (even Russell appears to
         have taken this view).  The axiom of choice is looked upon as
         suspicious in more mysterious ways, and is rejected as a logical
         principle by some opponents of logicism.
<P>
         In the following material I wish to let it be known that no
         statements are intended to speak in any way about the real world,
         our intended subject matter is entirely abstract, and the axiom of
         infinity, if it is in need of justification must be supported by
         other than empirical means.  In fact our domain of discourse is
         the natural numbers, whose existence I am content is no less
         controversial than that of the terms of the formal language which
         we present.  Ultimately, the existence of natural numbers is
         something which I would prefer to regard as true a priori, but on
         a matter so basic as this I do not expect that I will be able to
         offer convincing arguments to those who find this proposition
         doubtful.  I hope it will be the case that the material presented
         would be equally useful if accepted on the basis of postulating
         the existence of natural numbers.  We also consider it to be
         reasonable in the semantic framework proposed to accept that via a
         suitable encoding of rules for selecting natural numbers we may
         use natural numbers to represent collections of natural numbers
         which may be infinite (the rule "take a natural number and accept
         it without caveat or condition" determines the set of all natural
         numbers).
<P>
         This paper promotes several distinct causes.  At its most specific
         it presents a class of logical systems which may be suitable as
         foundations for mathematics, particularly for us in computer
         assisted mathematical activities.  These systems cannot be
         adequately presented without motivation, justification and some
         background.  An important element of such explanations is my
         position in general terms on the philosophical aspects of the
         relationship between mathematics and logic.  The best description
         of my position is "Logicism", and this paper therefore contains
         some arguments in support of a logicist position.  Of course there
         is really only one logicist position, that mathematics is
         reducible to logic, but a defence normally involves putting
         forward a formal system and arguing that this system is at once a
         logic and an adequate foundation for the development of
         Mathematics without need of further non logical postulates.
<P>
         It is appropriate to undertake some discussion of logicism partly
         because one of the main technical objectives of the proposed
         formal systems is to re-establish that freedom of abstraction
         present in Frege's foundational system in a context in which this
         is not spoiled by inconsistency.
