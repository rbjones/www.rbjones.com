       <H1>Mathematics is Analytic</H1>
         <H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
 <P>
         The primary purpose of this paper is to attempt a restatement of
         the logicist claim that mathematics is reducible to logic, and to
         produce some arguments in support of that claim.
<P>
         A second purpose is to provide some motivation for this position
         from the applications of mathematics in systems engineering.
<P>
         Motivation has greater importance in the establishment of
         doctrines which depend on some more or less arbitrary (even if
         carefully considered) choice in the meaning of technical terms.
         In this case it is primarily the scope of `logic' which is at
         issue, and in particular, whether the truths of logic are deemed
         to include matters of abstract ontology.  We argue on pragmatic
         grounds and on the basis of current practise that abstract
         ontology should be considered to be part of logic, while conceding
         that statements with ontological content present greater
         difficulties both in their justification and in their claim to
         absolute rather than merely conventional truths.
<P>
         The philosophy of Mathematics has, to judge by even quite recent
         accounts, been caught in a time warp since not long after the
         start of this century, when three mathematicians, namely Hilbert,
         Brouwer and Russell set forward their solutions to the paradoxes
         which had been causing some concern in the newly forming
         foundations of mathematics.  The three schools associated with
         these men have been known as formalism, Intuitionism and Logicism.
         These are usually presented as exclusive approaches to mathematics
         without any careful examination of whether the tenets of each
         school are genuinely incompatible.  In typical accounts,
         developments in mathematical logic since the formation of these
         schools are represented as having conclusively shown that the
         formalist program is unachievable, and that the logicist doctrine
         is insupportable.  Intuitionism is often represented as the only
         one of these schools to have escaped lethal criticism.
         Nonetheless, the main body of working mathematicians do not work
         within the constraints imposed by intuitionist doctrine, but have
         continued throughout this century along lines most readily
         interpreted through the logicist position.
<P>
         While Hilbert's formalist programme, containing in its original
         form important objectives which have since been shown to be
         unachievable, is probably beyond repair even though many of its
         methods have been shown to be of enduring utility, Logicism has
         suffered mainly from poor advocacy.  Intuitionism has probably
         benefited from a combination of opacity and aggressiveness.  The
         serious debilitation which intuitionism promised for mathematics
         was so horrifying to most mathematicians that they looked no
         further for flaws in the system or its justification.  As time
         passed by the scope of intuitionistic mathematics has been shown
         to be much greater than it had been feared, and intuitionism as
         apostle of constructive mathematics has presented itself as the
         natural and most appropriate approach for computer science and
         information systems engineering.  I believe that intuitionism
         deserves more cogent criticism than it has so far received.
<P>
         The possibility of reducing mathematics to logic was independently
         perceived by Frege and Russell towards the end of the 19th
         century.  Frege's magnum opus, in which he sought to effect the
         reduction, was with the publishers when Russell communicated to
         Frege the paradox which now bears his name.  Though this was more
         a technical problem than a fundamental conceptual failure, Frege
         was devastated by the revelation and never repaired the defect.
         Russell however, after great difficulty and anguish mainly flowing
         from philosophical problems rather than technical ones, ultimately
         put forward his logical theory of types.  Though through modern
         eyes this system is cumbersome it nevertheless was adequate for
         the task.  The main defects in this system are philosophical.  The
         first is the need for the axiom of reducibility and the lack of
         any convincing justification for this axiom.  The second is the
         ontological content of the axioms of choice and of infinity.
<P>
         In collaboration with A.N.Whitehead, Russell used his theory of
         types to develop a substantial part of mathematics as it then was,
         thereby demonstrating the reducibility of this mathematics to the
         theory of types.  Principia Mathematica became the definitive
         example of how mathematics was to be reduced to Logic, and to this
         day criticisms of the Logicist programme are usually simply
         criticisms of Russell's theory of types, with little consideration
         of more modern systems, and few arguments to show that defects in
         Russell's system are inescapable.
<P>
         From a more modern perspective, after more than half a century of
         further development in mathematical logic we can find many flaws
         in Russell's theory of types, its presentation in Principia
         Mathematica and its use in the derivation of mathematics.
         Most of thee detailed criticisms do not however bear upon the
         validity of then logicist thesis.
         Principia Mathematica is generally held to have failed to
         establish that thesis on the ground that three of the axioms used
         in Principia cannot easily be shown to be principles of logic.
<P>
         The disputed axioms are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
         The axiom of reducibility
<LI>
         The axiom of infinity
<LI>
         The axiom of choice
</OL>
<P>
         All of these axioms are essentially ontological in that their
         effect is simply to admit proof of the existence of entities which
         could not otherwise be shown to exist.
<P>
         The first of these, the axiom of reducibility, is the least
         defensible, but fortunately the one with which we can most readily
         dispense.
         It must surely be the one element of the system which gave Russell
         most heartache, for he found that he could not derive the
         mathematical results he required without it, but was completely
         unable to put forward any reason why we should believe it to be
         true.
<P>
         Fortunately we can now see that the need for this axiom arose from
         the ramified type theory which Russell put in place to prevent the
         `vicious circularity' which he thought responsible for
         contradictions in Frege's system.
         Modern mathematics is content with less draconian constraints
         which suffice to avoid contradiction without giving rise to the
         need for an axiom of reducibility.
