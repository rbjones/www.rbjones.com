From the days of ancient Greece the relationship between mathematics and logic has been close.
Aristotle's <A HREF="../classics/class001.htm">syllogistic logic</A>, together with the Axiomatic Method exemplified by <A HREF="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html">Euclid's Elements</A>
provided logical and methodological underpinnings for mathematics which were regarded as definitive for over 2000 years.
<P>
In the 19th century major advances were made in the foundations of analysis, leading ultimately to a virtually complete <A HREF="../../maths/math006.htm">formalisation of mathematics</A>.
Frege exposed deficiencies in Aristotle's Logic and offered instead his <A HREF="../bibliog/f.htm#Frege1879"><EM>Begriffschrift</EM></A> (formula language).
He then showed in <A HREF="../bibliog/f.htm#Frege1893"><EM>Grudgesetze der Arithmetik</EM></A> (the logical foundations of arithmetic) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic. 
<P>
Frege's logic was soon shown to be inconsistent, by <EM>Russell's Paradox</EM>, but within a few years
alternative logics were devised which incorporated the essential advances made by Frege while avoiding inconsistency
(so far as we can tell).
<P>
Further developments in Logic have continued throughout the 20th Century, and there are now many alternative logical and/or philosophical foundations for mathematics.
The relative merits of these remains a matter for debate.
