It is generally understood that set theory is required to do modern mathematics.
The existence of sets is, however, not logically necessary.
The truths of mathematics are therefore contingent.

Logicism is the view that Mathematics is analytic and/or that Mathematics is reducible to or identical with Logic.
The doctrine is most closely associated with Gottl&ouml;b Frege and Bertrand Russell.
Though they may neither of them have used the term <EM>logicism</EM>, it has become firmly associated with their shared view of the status of mathematical truths.

The primary sources of the logicist doctrine are Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell.
However, similar doctrines go back a long way.
For example, David Hume held that the truths of mathematics are "truths of
reason", and susceptible of demonstrative proof.

For greater detail on Russell's position see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/r.htm#Russell37"><EM>The Principles of Mathematics</EM></A>, of which the first edition was published while Russell was still struggling for a satisfactory way of avoiding inconsistency in his subsequent masterwork with Whitehead <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/r.htm#Russell10"><EM>Principia Mathematica</EM></A>.
The traces are not covered over in the second edition, which therefore gives a sense of history in the making.

<CENTER><B>Logical Systems</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Specific criticisms of the logical systems devised by Frege and Russell are now more of historical interest than in arguing against Logicism as a contemporary doctrine.
<P>
Putting aside the defects of these particular systems the most telling argument which remains against logicism is probably that the ontological premises necessary to carry through the development of mathematics cannot be shown to be principles of logic.

<CENTER><B>Ontology</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Modern mathematics is conducted in a rich ontological framework (such as is found in classical first order set theory), yet no convincing arguments have ever been presented to show that the existence of this elaborate hierarchy of sets (or any other adequate ontology) is logically necessary.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Consistency of Finite Universe</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
It is consistent to add to first order logic an axiom asserting that there is only one individual, and it cannot therefore be logically necessary that there are more than one.

<FONT SIZE=2>
G&ouml;del's incompleteness results have also impacted on the credibility of Logicism.
G&ouml;del's first incompleteness theorem shows that, however well patched up, neither Russell's Theory of Types nor any other formal logical system is capable of proving all true facts of elementary arithmetic.

<CENTER><B>alternatives</B></CENTER>
Notwithstanding the arguments against logicism, no alternative account of the status of mathematical propositions is convincing.
<CENTER><B>tradition</B></CENTER>
Philosophers throughout history have claimed that propositions such as:
<CENTER>
	1+1=2
</CENTER>
are necessarily true.
<BR>
This necessity flows from the <EM>meaning</EM> of the terms employed in the proposition.
<BR>
<CENTER><B>ontology presupposed, not asserted</B></CENTER>
The proposition:
<CENTER>
	Pegasus has wings
</CENTER>
might be considered analytic on the grounds that it presupposes (at worst) rather than asserts the existence of Pegasus, and Pegasus is <EM>by definition</EM> a winged horse.
<P>
In a similar way we may claim that the existence of natural numbers is presupposed rather than asserted by the theory of arithmetic.
Arithmetic conjectures are <EM>about</EM> the natural numbers and we are able to determine their truth or falsity in many cases, on the basis of knowledge of the intended structure of the number system which is independent of settling in any absolute sense whether the natural numbers "exist".

<CENTER><B>mathematical methods <I>a priori</I></B></CENTER>
To the present day Mathematicians continue to work with methods which are appropriate only to the establishment of a priori, necessary truths.
They regard an appeal to experimental evidence as irrelevant and inadmissible (notwithstanding their willingness to permit digital computers to contribute to a mathematical proof).
<CENTER><B>methods not disputed</B></CENTER>
Those who dispute the logicist thesis do not propose that mathematicians should change to experimental methods.
At worst the concession that mathematical truths should be considered hypothetical might be forced.
This is the position adopted by Russell when he concluded that the axiom of infinity was contingent.
It seems however more plausible to describe the necessary premises as presuppositions rather than as hypotheses.
<CENTER><B>scope of necessity</B></CENTER>
A defence of Logicism can be founded on an argument about the extent of logical necessity, which is to some extent a matter of arguing the merits of a broader conception of logical necessity than is at present widely accepted.
An alternative defence can be based on a formulation of the thesis in terms of analyticity, which need not depend on any "reduction to logic".
The logical positivist A.J.Ayer adopted this latter approach when speaking of <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../history/aaq001.htm#Q001">the analyticity of mathematics</A></I> in <I><A TARGET="_top" HREF="../bibliog/a.htm#Ayer36">Language Truth and Logic</A></I>.
