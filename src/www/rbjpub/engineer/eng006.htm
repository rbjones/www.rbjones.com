Utopian enginering is a variety of social engineering which is optimistic and comprehensive. It involves coming up with a blueprint for a preferred future, and taking measures to realise that future.

A key problem for utopian engineers is how to influence the future of society without adopting totalitarian methods.
The solution is anarchy, or the market.

A consensual approach to utopian engineering on a global scale.
Substantially market-based, pluralistic, mass participation based on visions of the future developed in cyberspace and implemented by concensus driven individual action, both economic and political.

<CENTER><B>Popper's Dichotomies</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
In Chapter 9 of <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../philos/bibliog/p.htm#Popper45a"><I>The Open Society and its Enemies</I></A> <A TARGET="_top" HREF="../philos/bibliog/popp45a.htm#Chap9"><IMG SRC="../../rbjgifs/smnote.gif" ALT="notes" BORDER=0 ALIGN=TOP></A>
Popper offered two dichotomies.
The first was between <I>historicism</I>, a fatalistic attempt to predict social futures, and <I>social engineering</I> which attempts to influence the future.
Social engineering is then divided into <I>utopian engineering</I> and <I>piecemeal engineering</I>.
<I>Utopian engineering</I> involves a grand blueprint for the future of society, and Popper thought, leads inevitably to totalitarianism (is this historicist?).
<I>Piecemeal engineering</I> tinkers with small parts of the system at a time, and has no overall plan.
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Utopian Engineering</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
I aim here to show that the second dichotomy is a false one by putting forward an approach to utopian engineering which is diametrically opposed to totalitarianism.
Popper was writing 50 years ago I doubt that he would be quite so dogmatic if he were writing today.
There is no doubt that continued vigilence against the concentration of power of any kind is desirable, though we may now wonder whether the concentration of <I>political</I> power is our greatest concern.
The approach to utopian engineering is a study in how the conception and implementation of an ideal society might be accomplished as a distributed social activity, involving everyone, and diminishing the power associated with political office or great wealth.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Popper clearly thought you had to do these once and for all, one after the next.
I wouldn't bet on that working either.
I'm talking about continuously evolving pluralistic visions of the future.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Aestheticism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Popper complains that it is immoral to use people as the material for realising some aesthetic ideal.
I don't believe that beauty should be considered more important than human lives, but provided the whole process is participatory, pluralistic and consensual, aesthetic considerations are quite legitimate.
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Radicalism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Popper believed that it was irrational to suppose that radical changes will work.
I believe that in the information age radical changes will take place whether we like it or not, and I'd rather that we made some attempts to steer the ship.
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Romanticism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Popper also regards rationality and romanticism as incompatible.
I think we should have our ideals, and we should also be skeptical about whether they can be realised.
But not too skeptical.
This is rational.
To me it is irrational not to think about where we are going.

<CENTER><B>What is an Archy?</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
An "archy" is a collection of agents organised by a principle of control, in which some agents have authority over others, and instruct their "subordinates" about what they must do. 
Special kinds of archy include <I>hierarchies</I>, <I>patriarchies</I>, <I>matriarchies</I>.
Totalitarian regimes are especially nasty archies.
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>What is Anarchy?</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
"Anarchy" is the word used to describe a collection of independent agents organised by dynamic consensual relationships, i.e. <I>without</I> "archy".
The most well known near anarchies are market economies and the internet.
In the context of politics the word anarchy concerns the abolition of the state.

The collapse of centrally planned socialist Russia and the emergence and growth of the internet are the most spectacular recent indications that anarchy works better than archy.

<CENTER><B>Anarchic Utopian Engineering</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
The approach to utopian engineering here proposed is <I>anarchic</I>.
The easiest way to understand this is to think of markets.
The proposal is essentially that markets will evolve to answer utopian purposes as well as day to day needs.

<CENTER><B>Anarchy and Totalitarianism</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Anarchy is diametrically opposed to totalitarianism, and is therefore a plausible response to <A HREF="#popper">Popper's critique</A>.</FONT>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<CENTER><B>Economic v. Political</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Market based anarchic methods for utopian engineering do not depend upon constitutional change, but encourage a shift from state sponsored to market solutions.
Nevertheless any forward looking utopian thinking is bound to address the role of the state and its constitution.
An anarchic preference would push the state further <I>away</I> from totalitarianism, beyond democracy as we now know it.
It might diminish the role of the state and would increase its responsiveness to its customers.

As the information economy grows and the pace of change continues to accelerate an increasing number of people will contribute to the analysis of possibilities for the future and to the design of preferred scenarios.
The space of possible futures will be presented in distributed networked hypermedia (WWW), together with huge amounts of analysis, and lobbying.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Alongside analysis of possible and preferred outcomes there will also be a lot of varied and conflicting assessment of what is <I>actually</I> happening and where we are <I>really</I> heading.
This is part of a global negative feedback loop which is a vital part of the continuous process of piloting our way to our preferred future.

<FONT SIZE=2>
The third vital component in this continuous process is the translation of error reports into action plans.
For market implemented utopian engineering this action must ultimately take place when the consumer makes purchase decisions.
Somehow or other he needs to be able to decide rapidly which purchase decisions will contribute most to <I>his</I> preferred futures.
