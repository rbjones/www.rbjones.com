An important aspect of moving towards the automation of engineering design is the continual evolution of the languages used for describing requirements and designs and for modelling the behaviour of systems.

<FONT SIZE=2>
Engineering is about <I>building</I>, or <I>constructing</I> things which satisfy some <I>purpose</I> or <I>requirement</I>.
This used to mean physical things but the invention of the computer lead to large scale constructive activities which delivered abstract entities and so we began to talk of <I>software  engineering</I>.
The approaching information age will broaden this to other kinds of <I>information engineering</I>.

<FONT SIZE=2>
The purpose bit is important, and distinguishes engineering from art.
Artists can spend hugh amounts of time and effort creating works of art.
However their ends are aesthetic rather than practical, and this distinguishes art from engineering.

Engineers need tools, and building tools is engineering.
So Engineering is a reflexive discipline.
However, some of the tools engineers need are intellectual tools, and this leads to connections between engineering and science, mathematics, logic and philosophy.
This allows us to consider <I>analytic philosophy</I> in the light of its contribution to engineering methods.

If we take a pro-active attitude towards the future of society then we may consider our attempts to influence that future as a kind of engineering.
Social Engineering, Utopian Engineering, Memetic Engineering all belong in this most tenuous engineering subdomain.

Another important element of engineering is that it is methodical.
Some might say scientific.
Methods may also be thought of as intellectual tools, and insofar as we are able to approach the development of methods in a systematic way we may consider this too as an engineering enterprise.
Process engineering comes to mind.

The reason for putting up this idealisation of engineering methods is to suggest that <I>ideally</I> there is a nice chunk of it which is <I>logical</I> or <I>mathematical</I>.
If its a physical system then the physical bits are <I>build</I> and <I>test</I>.

<CENTER><B>analytic engineering</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Logic and Maths involve what philosopher's call <I>analytic</I> truths, and the point about these is that you don't need real world knowledge to do them, so they are particularly suitable for getting nailed by computer.
If we could crack the automation of reasoning then it would substantially increase our advantage from getting closer to this idealised engineering process.

<FONT SIZE=2>
In particular I'd like to emphasise the potentially logical character of the design process.
The necessary knowledge of the behaviour of the physical systems involved is generally already in place before design begins, in the form of mathematical models.
If we also has formal requirements specifications then the problem of producing a design which complies with the requirements assuming that the models are good is purely logical.
If we can automate logic and formalise the models then we can provide machine support or complete automation of the design process.

<FONT SIZE=2>
The single most important need for the application of logic based techniques to the automation of engineering problem solving is the need for better languages.
First this means languages whose <I>meaning</I> is well defined.
Next it means well structured languages which avoid obscure imperative algorithmic specifications in favour of clear declarative specifications.
If the semantics is itself defined in a well defined formal notation that would be even better.
So the language engineering part of Factasia <I>will</I> be concerned with finding nice ways of designing languages which <I>not only</I> give well designed and well defined languages but also aid the building of tools to do things with the languages, including reasoning and problem solving.
