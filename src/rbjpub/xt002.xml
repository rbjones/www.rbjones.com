<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
This is a "stack" of work in progress on this website.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<p>
This is an experiment to help me keep track of what I am working on (or perhaps more the ones I'm not actually working on but have left in mid flow to follow some other hare).
</p>
<p>
I expect it to be a stack only in the loosest sense.
Which is, that the stuff at the top is what I'm working on.
The stuff later I was working on before that, and the further down you go the more distant the prospect that I will ever get back to it.

<subsec>
I generally have so many pages in an incomplete state (most of them!) that I loose track of pages before I ever finish them.
Maybe this page will help me to get things nearer to completion.

<subsec>
These documents, mostly not far progressed, are the center of a shift in focus of my philosophical thinking, oriented toward making my philosophy (even) less academic.
I need to put more of myself into my philosophy, not just the intellectual side.

Before I started trying to integrate the romantic side of philosophy, my main preoccupation was to put forward a sceptical or positivistic philosophical stance.

I could be some time before I get back to thinking about metaphysics, with the possible exception of abstract ontology.
I don't rank metaphysics as particularly important.
