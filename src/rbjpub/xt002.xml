<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
This is a "stack" of work in progress on this website.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<p>
This is an experiment to help me keep track of what I am working on (or perhaps more the ones I'm not actually working on but have left in mid flow to follow some other hare).
</p>
<p>
I expect it to be a stack only in the loosest sense.
Which is, that the stuff at the top is what I'm working on.
The stuff later I was working on before that, and the further down you go the more distant the prospect that I will ever get back to it.

<subsec>
I generally have so many pages in an incomplete state (most of them!) that I loose track of pages before I ever finish them.
Maybe this page will help me to get things nearer to completion.

<secref title="Metaphysics">
<abstract>
Metaphysics has come back to the top of the stack for two reasons.
Firstly this move was provoked by my being referred to Algebraic Geometry by Rob Arthan as a better way of approaching differential geometry and more generally the matheamtics of physics.
(my main problem with the kind of metaphysics I am interested is in the mathematica; prerequisites for a formal analysis of the issues).

There are two main objectives here.
The first is to articulate a positivistic conception of metaphysics.
The second is to progress certain aspects of that.
The three specific aspects to progress are abstract ontology, space-time and concrete ontology.

Before I started trying to integrate the romantic side of philosophy, my main preoccupation was to put forward a sceptical or positivistic philosophical stance.
