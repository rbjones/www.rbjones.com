                       This is a collection of materials written in preparation for philosophical discussions.  The notes were mainly for my own use, not necessarily to be distributed, the overheads were prepared for use in online meetings during COVID lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.
		       The dates show are the dates of the meetings for which the notes or overheads were prepared, and it is possibly that the materials were subsequently modified, and that they may have been used for more than one meeting, since during that time I participated in two different discussion groups.   Normally, since the groups were discussion groups, not lectures or seminars, the discussion would not have followed the materials at all closely (or at all?).

                           ontology and metaphysics, in which I conclude in favour of the possibility that consciousness
                           is no big deal (though important).

                        <div class="subsec">
                           
                           The pace of constitutional change has accelerated over recent decades,
                           and the departure of the UK from the European Union not only in itself
                           requires major constitutional changes, but also exposes weaknesses in
                           the constitution which may provoke further change.
                           Because we do not have a written constitution which has a special status
                           relative to other legislation, controversial changes to the constitution
                           may be undertaken on the basis of a simple parliamentary majority with little
                           or no public consultation.
                           This risks changes which are partisan rather than consensual, and that respond
                           to intellectual or ideological trends alien to our historical traditions including
                           our democracy and the free speech on which it depends.
                           This document provides notes for a discussion of these matters.

                           A number of factors, conspicuous as we make our way into the 21st century, seem to
                           make a coherent philosophical underpinning for moral, political and economic affairs
                           especially difficult to formulate.
                           These notes are intended to facilitate discussion of the challenges and opportunities
                           and a range of possible philosophical responses to them.
