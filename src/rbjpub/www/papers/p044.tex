\section{Introduction}

This essay concerns epistemology, and is oriented toward its future in a way which makes  the tern \emph{synthetic epistemology} appropriate, if only for the final part.
Before that synthesis I set a context which is informed first by my lay understanding of biological and cultural evolution which made homo sapiens and ``Western Culture''.
In that context I then give some consideration to the final stages in the evolution of that culture which bring us to our contemporary predicament, and to some speculation about where it might lead from here.
All this is in preparation for the synthesis of an epistemology engineered for a future in which intelligence propagates across our galaxy and humans become a small part of a much larger knowledge gathering enterprise.

In this introduction a skeleton for that essay is sketched in three sections addressing those the parts into which this monograph falls.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Biological and Cultural Evolution of Epistemology.
The process of evolution may be thought of as an aggregation of knowledge about how to construct organisms capable of survival and reproduction in various ecological niches, which from simple beginnings gradually become progressively involved themselves in gathering knowledge about their environment, transmitting a body of knowledge through culture and gradually refining those capabilities partly by epistemological reflection and the evolution of epistemic standards.
\item The evolution of Western Culture down to the present day is considered, identifying one or two key issues arising and spculating about the destination of the continuing trajectory.
\item A forward projection is undertaken of an episteme intended to be instrumental in securing prosperity and growth while most importantly maximising fulfillment among human beings. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Evolution of Cognition}

\section{The Evolution of Epistemology}

\section{Synthetic Epistemology}

Having reviewed 4 Billion years of epistemological evolution, innovation and perhaps pathology, I now look to the future.

I cannot simply look at the future in even the tenuous way in which I speculate about the past, so I will begin with some methodological observations.

The first point I will make is that what is said here is both prediction and proposal,
