\section*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}

This is intended to be a sketch of a larger, book sized, project and a contender for the introduction to the book, if ultimately this kind of introduction seems a good idea.
Otherwise, its still a stage in working out the ideas to be addressed in the larger format.

\section{Introduction}

Epistemology is the theory of knowledge, a branch of philosophy.
The word ``episteme'' has roots at least as far back as Aristotle, who used it's Greek predecessor as a term for ``scientific'' knowledge, as it was then known.
In the hands of postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault the term ``episteme'' was used to speak of the standards imposed on knowledge more generally, treated as a power-play by culturally dominant groups.
This cynical view of epistemic standards provided a justification for the weaponisaton of radical epistemic innovations, ostensibly for the emancipation of the underpriveliged, by political activists dedicated to the complete overthrow of the western cultural hegemony which was held to sustain global capitalism.

I will use the term here to refer to those aspects of a culture or subculture which determine or influence what is accepted as knowledge.
The term ``synthetic epistemology'' I have coined to talk about the philosophical activity of synthesising epistemes, or reasoning about such syntheses.
In the context of Michel Foucault's philosophy this constitutes a power play, in which reading I acquiesce.

By way of mitigating that acquiescence, my inclination is to regard evolution as cultivating instrumental epistemes, those which are conducive to the proliferation of humanity or its progeny.
A distinction between domains in which knowledge is objective and those in which standards are discretionary is central to my synthesis.
In the domain of the objective, instrumentality abhors the intervention of political motivations into epistemic standards.
They simply are not effective or relevant.
The syntheses undertaken in this context, are therefore not intended to align with the interests of any social grouping, but with considerations which are of general utility.
This mitigation bears only upon the realms, should there be any, of objective knowledge, and does not extend to the establishment of value systems, and the distinction between these two may not be straightforward to make in an objective way, and is one of the first to have been challenged by the post-Marxist ideologies to which Foucault has (perhaps unwilttingly) contributed.
I don't expect to convince those wed to the radical epistemological innovations of our time.

The discussion is divided into the following parts.
First it is necessary to speculate about how the proliferation of humanity and its progeny or product will proceed.
Then on the basis of that speculation, I will outline some of the broad epistemological features likely to emerge.
An evolutionary perspective will prove important in these speculations.
On the basis of those anticipated features I will then begin to synthesise an episteme in three stages, addressing logical, empirical and evaluative knowledge following that classification derived from the philosophy of David Hume substantially as as refined in the works of Rudolf Carnap.

Hume classification came as two distinctions both of which have sometimes been called ``Hume's fork''.
The first is the distinction between, as Hume put it, relations between ideas, and matters of fact.
In the more recent terminology this is the distinction between logical and empirical propositions.
The second is that suggested by Hume's dictum, ``you cannot derive and ought from an is'', which presumes a clear distinction moral judgements and factual or logical claims.
This latter distinction can be extended to include with moral judgements other (though not all) evaluative claims.

These distinctions have a long history, perhaps not of precise articulation, but of faltering approaches, gradually homing in on the fundamental distinctions behind those tenuos descriptions, some of which I will sketch below.

It is not my intention here to discover truths of epistemology.
It is for us to chose how to discover, evaluate, organise and apply knowledge, and though common standards are highly desirable, there is always room for debate about what they should be.
This is written as a contribution to the continous evolution of epistemological standards.

In that description of my enterprise you may immediately sense my divergemce from at least two other attitudes to epistemology.
The first is any kind of epistemological absolutism.
It is up to us where we place the boundary between conjecture and fact, or indeed, whether we have such a dichotomy rather than some more complex characterisation.
\footnote{Just as hot and cold were displaced for many purposes by quantitative measures, some philosophers have sought quantitative evaluation of the evidential support for a scientific hypothesis.}
The second is the radical relativism which we might see in Michel Foucault, and the weaponisation of epistemology through standpoint epistemology which was enabled by it.
Knowledge is important, it enables those who possess it to flourish, and facilitates their fulfillment.
Epistemes facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and guard against the degradation of our understanding of the world.
They are not all equally effective, they evolve with us, and this enterprise is part of the evolution of that evolutionary process.

\section{Epistemic Futures}

What does the future hold, what knowledge would facilitate that future and what kind of episteme would best enable its cultivation?
These questions are central to the epistemological synthesis at hand.

Futurists make predictions about the distant future by making a variety of assumptions and then reasoning forward from those assumptions.
The kinds of assumptions they make depend in part on what kinds of predictions they seek.

I anticipate that a future expansion across the Milky way engineered by homo sapiens will involve very large scale research in science and technology and that epistemic innovation may therefore be a significant enabler.

In some futuristic explorations, the timescale is large and it is presumed that science and technology reach stasis early in the process, so that for the major part of the expansion there is no more innovation in the mechanics of proliferation.
I have doubts about whether it is possible to settle all the laws of physics, let alone the possible technological developments which might facilitate proliferation, and will consider primarily an extended period of proliferation during which the further development of science and technology continue to be sufficiently advantageous that forward proliferation using the most recent technoligies will continue to dominate.

\subsection{Proliferation}

The earth is now about 4 billion years old, and we here look maybe 4 billion years into the future.
That projection is built on identifying (guessing) which contemporary developments (primarily in science and technology) seem likely to have greatest impact on the long term future, bearing in mind the primary thrust of the evolutionary imperative, ``proliferate!''.

Over the next few billions of years, from a point at which serious contemplation of our becoming a ``multiplanetary species'' is topical and credible, it is natural to suppose that the proliferation of humanity and its progeny (not necessarily biological) will involve their spread across the Milky Way galaxy, and perhaps into other galaxies.
The Milky Way is approximately 200,000 light years in size.
Achieving a rate of spread across the galaxy of as little as one hundredth the speed of light would take us one fifth the span of the galaxy, encompassing more than a billion stars.
The considerations we adduce here don't depend upon predicting the scale of the potential spread, but do assume that we will achieve interstellar proliferation.

\cite{sandberg-sme}

\subsubsection{Proliferate What?}

The average evolutionary span of a mammalian species is a few million years, so it is doubtful  whether homo sapiens will still exist a few billion years hence.
However, homo sapiens is unprecedented in earthly evolution in many ways, so its not out of the question.
What seems much more doubtful is that evolution will be brought to a halt, in a context in which multiple technological developments threaten to transform and accelerate it.

The evolution of homo sapiens will inevitably be influenced by the deployment of technologies associated with synthetic biology.
The tranisition thus enabled will completely transform the nature of biological evolution, since variation may then be dfesigned rather than random or combinatorial, and selection of genetic material for propagation will no longer be ``natural''.
Similar hybrid evolutionary processes will accelerate the development of synthetic self-propagating intelligent systems. 

Both biological and non-organic successors to homo sapiens, which have evolved or been engineered during interstellar proliferation are likely to be much better adapted for proliferation than homo sapiens, and an understanding of the process of proliferation may therefore benefit from some consideration of what characteristics those successors might have.

It is already aknowledged that the colonisation of Mars would involve the use of robotics in the first instance to create an environment suitable for human habitation, so it is not unreasonably to suppose that the much greater challenges involved in interstellar proliferation would be realised primarily by autonomous intelligent systems which bear little resemblance to life on earth.

Even without the need for adaptation to totally new kinds of environments, judging by the history of the evolution of life, the species of \emph{homo sapiens} would be unlikley to survive longer than a few million years, and we are already aware of evolutionary possibilities which would be advantageous even for interplanetary travel within our solar system, in the form for example of a gene providing greater resilience against harmful radiation.
Independently of any motivation presented by the desire for interstellar migration, the technologies for designed intervention in the human genome, though considered ethically problematic, will inevitably become a dominating factor in human evolution.

\section{Matters of Logic}

The distinction between logical and empirical truth is fundamental to the epistemic developments discussed in this work, and it will be helpful in clarifying that distinction to talk about its history.


This account of the history of the development of logic is focussed on giving makingintelligible a particular view of the nature of logical truth and the purposes for which and ways in which a clear understanding of this conception of logical truth can be instrumental.
The notion of logical truth has been controversial, as indeed most philosophical concepts can be from time to time, particularly because of the centrality of that notion in the doctrines of Rudolf Carnap and the logical positivists, and (I would say) the importance to American philosophers of finding their own way and asserting their strengthg in mid 20th Century philosophical politics.
There is no intention here to revive the debate about what is ``logical truth'', my use of that term, even though it is very close to the preferred usage if Rudolf Carnao, is not a claim about the meaning of the term, it is a choice of terminology which is convenient for describing the \emph{episteme} to the construction of which this work is devolted.

The distinction between logical and empirical truth is rooted in the nature of language, and some practical application of logical truth is implicit in the skills which constitute linguistic competence.
The part of language which we can call `propositional' and consists in the use of indicative sentences depends for its use upon an understanding of the meaning of the conceots which can be asserted of the world or its constituents.
One aspect of that knowledge is the understanding of various conceptual inclusions.
A rich source of these is taxonomic heirarchies, and the knowledge of the conceptual inclusion in such heirarchies yields logical truths of which mere comprehension of tha language assures us, without need to inspect the world for corroboration.

For signs of systematic use of logical inference we have to wait quite a long time, from the birth of language, maybe coeval with homo sapiens some two or three hundred thousand years ago to the advent of mathematics as a theoretical discipline in ancient Greece.
Prior mathematics, Bablylonian arithmetic and Egyptian geometry, consisted in techniques for achieving certain practical ends, which Greek antiquity would have called logicstics rather than mathematics.
From about 600 BC the development of mathematics as a theoretical discipline began, seeking theoretical principles established not by successful application, but by deductive proof.

The deductive method was applied throughout the development of Greek mathematics, but was best exhibited in the development of Euclidean geometry, which showed it to be a highly reliable method for establishing geometric truths.
These early Greek philosophers also sought to understand the world and the cosmos through reason, and in these broader realms were rather less successful.
Theories advanced in these matters were not supported by deductive proof, were frequently contradicted, and eluded concensus.

In this way, the axiomatic method deployed for geometry and later systematised by Aristotle and Euclid came to be envied by all who wanted their opinions to be taken as gospel, and would often be misapplied or its merits fraudulently claimed for less reliable methods.
In clarifying the nature and boundaries of \emph{logical truth} the scope of deductive methods can be made clear.
This makes a proper evaluation of other kinds of claims to knowledge more readily achievable.

After the period of pre-Socratic philosophy, in which the disparate achievements of reason were laid bare, resolution of the disparities was sought in the two great classical philosophical systems, those of Plato and Aristotle.
It is here that much of the terminology connected with the distinction between logical and empirical truth discussed, as well as the ideas behind later terminological developments.

Plato was influenced by the philosophers Heraclitus\index{Heraclitus} and Parmenides\index{Parmenides}.
Heraclitus held that everything was in constant flux, Parmenides that change was impossible.
Parmenides arrived at his position by reason, Heraclitus was acquainted with the chaos of the world through his senses.
Plato's resolved these apparently contradictory philosophies by identifying two distinct domains, a realm of ideal forms, immutable and accessible to reason, of which certain knowledge could therefore be had, and a realm of appearances, fleeting and ephemeral, brought to us by our senses, of which we could have only opinion, not knowledge.
The realm of Platonic ``forms'' or universals, and one imperfectly revealed by our senses.
A classical predecessor to what might now be rendered as a realm of abstract objects, and one of material entities.

David Hume offered an intermediate position between this classical philosophies of Plato and Aristotle and more contemporary philosophy of Rudolf Carnap.

Hume makes the distinction thus:

\begin{quote}
``ALL the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided
  into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact.'' 
\end{quote}

Which we may characterise as sharing with Plato a classification by subject matter with multiple dimensions of significance.

He gives the following description of ``Relations of ideas'':

\begin{quote}
``Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and
Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either
intuitively or demonstratively certain.
That the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the two
sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these
figures.
That three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses a
relation between these numbers.
Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of
thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the
universe.
Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths
demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty and
evidence.''
\end{quote}

I'll go through this in some detail.
This connects with Plato in that the primary distinction is about subject matter, and that the distinction is connected with certain other distinctions.
The other distinctions found in Plato are combined into one as the distinction that 
we obtain knowledge about the forms by reason, but only have opinion about the world of appearances derived from our senses.
This distinguishes two ways of coming to kowledge ot opinion, and two correponding results of such enquiries.
What we have here might be called a ``triple dicholtomy'' in which three different characterisations are held to yield closely related distinctions, and we will see that progress in clarifying the notion of logical truth has advanced through the refinement of similar dichotomies.

The things being classified are usually sentences, judgements or propositions.
The distinctions made of of the following kinds:
\begin{itemize}

\item[Semantic] Concerned with the meaning of a sentence, or its subject matter, what the sentence is about or what it says about its subject.
  
\item[Epistemological] Concerned with how knowledge or opinion about the truth of the sentence or proposition is to be obtained, and/or justified.

\item[Confidence] Whether one can have certainty on the matter or not.

\item[Modal Status] Whether the sentence or proposition is necessary or contingent.
  
\end{itemize}
