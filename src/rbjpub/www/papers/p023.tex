\section{Thoughts on the History of The Triple-Dichotomy}

\subsection{What Kind of History?}

I am myself more interested in the future than the past, and am in various ways unsuited to historical scholarship.

However, in attempting to articulate a philosophical framework for the future, for the sake of intelligibility I have felt it desirable to relate the intended philosophical position to the history of the subject.
In attempting to do this I find that the superficial nature of my knoweldge of past philosophers is a big problem.

Even if I had a more complete historical knowledge, I don't believe this would fix my problem.
What is happening instead is that my idea of what is needed is gradually being refined, and my conception of what is needed is evolving.

It may be worth referring to the manner in which Kripke addressed a problem raised by Wittgenstein.
He wanted to say something about Wittgenstein's private language argument without entering into the
question of exactly what Wittgenstein meant.
So he considered (I believe) certain things which Wittgenstein \emph{might} have meant, and discussed them, without going into the question of whether or not these really were what Wittgenstein had intended.

In the exposition of the philosophical position which I have here in mind, one not so far in many respects, from the central tenet's of Rudolf Carnap, it will be helpful to contrast the proposed position with certain alternative views which may be thought of as charicatures of the positions of previous philosophers on the issues at stake.
In this, simple contrasts will serve our purposes best, so that they may be readily grasped by the reader and will then serve to clarify my proposal by contrast.
Philosophers often spend a lifetime developing and articulating their philosophical ideas, and contemporary scholars may devote a large part of a lifetime to the interpretation of an important philosopher.
An accurate account of such a philosopher will not serve our purposes, but using the name of a philosopher as a label for a position closer to his than any other may.

It is the ``triple dichotomy'' which I seek to illuminate in some such manner.
In doing so I propose to begin with a short statment of position, which is to say, a proposal for how the terminology might best be used, and then to further elucidate the proposal and its merits through an account of how it might have evolved, using idealised acccounts of positions not far from those which helped form our present understanding of the issues.

There is to this an informal and a formal side, this being the informal side.
Of the more formal side I suggest that the adoption of the proposed concepts is \emph{without loss of generality}, though I lack anything close to a proof of that claim.
In a sense, it is of the essence that I feel able to make that claim, since an element of the complex of ideas is foundational.
The foundational claim is that in respect of semantics and deductive proof there are systems, or closely related familiies of systems which offer near universal foundations to which alternatives are reducible (somehow).


\subsection{What is it?}

By the ``triple dichotomy'' I mean the following three distinctions:

\begin{itemize}
\item necessary-contingent
\item \emph{a priori}-\emph{a posteriori}
\item analytic-synthetic
\end{itemize}

Of course philosophers may not always have had the same thing in mind when they used these terms,
i.e. they might have had distinct understandings of the \emph{meanings} of the terms, as well as having divergent views on their \emph{extension}s.
Disentangling from what a philosopher has written where he stands on these is very difficult, and I suspect that often philosphers do not have definite views to be discovered.
It is possible to have definite views on what falls under these concepts without having such a definite understanding of what they mean.

It is the concepts as they were understood by Rudolf Carnap which concern us here.
This understanding corresponding quite well the distinction at the centre of David Hume's philosophy sometimes called ``Hume's fork'' (though Carnap's presentation is more refined and precise).
This point exposes one of the difficulties which face comparison between philosophical positions widely separated in time.
There is a world of difference between what Carnap says about the analytic/synthetic distinction and what Hume says about his fork.
There are two ways in which a concept may evolve.
It may evolve into a different concept, or it may evolve into a more precisely drawn exposition of the same concept.

How can it be the same?
I suggest a weak and a strong sense, and assert them both.
Consider the descriptions of the concepts as ``loose''; as not picking out the concept uniquely but as encompassing a collection of concepts which satisfy that same description.
A second ``tighter'' (but still ``loose'') description may be considered a refined description of ``the same'' concept if every concept which satisfies the second description also satisfies the earlier one.
To use the term ``same'' in that sense is controversial, since that kind of ``sameness'' is assymetric.
For a stronger notion of sameness, we might accept that a loose description is intended to refer to a single concept but fails to be sufficiently precise, i.e. is not ``definite'' in the technical sense of being satisfied by just one concept.
Two such descriptions may be said to be of the same concept if we believe that the same single concept is intended by both descriptions.
I doubt that Hume and Carnap had the same concepts in mind in that stronger sense, so I will venture an intermediate notion of sameness, even at risk of introducing ideas which both philosophers might dislike.
I believe that among the concepts which satisfy the two descriptions there is one concept which is much more important, philosophically in some sense more fundamental that the others, and that the two philosophers have that single concept in mind.

Both Hume and Carnap were positivists who rejected certain conceptions of metaphysics.
The rejection is more fully worked out in Carnap, who replaced metaphysics with semantics, making the meaning of concepts a matter of convention embodied in the semantics of languages.
These conventions were to be chosen on pragmatic grounds, but Carnap's idea of the pragmatic encompassed any consideration short of \emph{metaphysics} in that particular and narrow sense in which Carnap uses the term (which allows us free choice of ontology in language design without regarding such a choice as constituting metaphyics).
Despite this rejection of metaphysics, it is clear that both philosophers placed the analytic/synthetic distinction at the center of their philosophy.
There is here a choice which, even if technically considered ``pragmatic'' is in some way fundamental, and which we might reasonably regard as prior to the choice of linguistic conventions; not relative to choice of language, but absolute in character, perhaps even metaphysical.

The roots of this distinction I suggest lie in a particularly fecund abstraction from natural language which provides a basis for the idealised language in which formal science (both \emph{a priori} and \emph{a posteriori}) might be undertaken.


I think of the history of the evolution of these concepts as having its most prominent landmarks in the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Frege, Wittgenstein and Carnap.
So this history hangs around that list of philosophers.

I have only a superficial knowledge of the history of philosophy.
This is not a contribution to the history of philosophy, but rather, an attempt to elucidate these concepts, which we may regard as mediated by stories about fictional philosophers faintly similar to these well known figures.

\subsubsection{Plato}

Long before Plato, Greek mathematicians and philosophers became aware of the power of deductive reasoning, primarily by using it to establish mathematical theorems.
When philosophers tried to reason about the word, things went awry.
Different philosophers arrived at completely opposite conclusions.
A notable example close to Plato's time was the disagreement between Parmenides and Heraclitus, of whom the first held that nothing changes, and the second that nothing remains the same.

Plato tried to square this circle.
He believed in mathematics, in philosophy, and in deductive reasoning as a means to knowledge in both spheres, and he came up with a philosophical system which explained why deduction worked well in mathematics but failed miserably as it had been practiced by philosophers beyond mathematics, and which offered a basis for reliable philosophical reasoning.

Plato had concluded that there were two different worlds which he thought of as the \emph{real} word, a world of ideas or forms accessible to the intellect through reason, and a illusory world of sensory appearances.
The former world was eternal, changeless and accessible to true knowledge, the latter fleeting, in perpetual flux, a matter of opinion rather than true knowledge.

This \emph{metaphysic} explains why philosphers have disagreed, and offers a way in which philosophy can be like mathematics, by undertaking what we might now call \emph{logical analysis}.
In relation to Parmenides and Heralclitus, there is here a kind of resolution to their conflict.
We may think of Parmenides as speaking of the world of forms, eternal and unchangeable, and Heraclitus as confused by the world of appearances, ephemeral and deceptive, forever changing.

More important perhaps is the possibility that philosophers, with the benefit of Plato's wisdom, will confine their thinking to the proper domain of reason, the world of ideal forms, and thereby realise that success so far only found in mathematics, definitive resolutions to philosophical problems.

Plato was of course an enormously influential philosopher, and I wouldn't venture an opinion about the most important part of his philosophical legacy.
But for the purposes of this little narrative on the tripl-dichotomy, what stands out to me is the connection with the views of David Hume.
For David Hume's description of his ``fork'', which we will come to later, is a description which connects with Plato's.
In particular, Plato's characterisation of the difference between reliable knowledge and fleeting opinion is in terms of its subject matter.
Hume does not use the same language to describe these domains, but he too distinguishes in terms of subject matter, and what he calls ``relations between ideas'' is not entirely dissimilar to the study of Plato's ideal forms.
There are big differences, but some similarities of importance.

\subsection{Aristotle}

Here are two aspects of Aristotle's philosophy which seem to me to connect.

The parts of Aristotle's philosophy which seem most relevant are The Organon, a group of six works related to logic, and the Metaphysics.
That part of the Metaphysics which seems most relevant is his Categories, and earlier approach to which is also present in The Organon.

The Organon presents the idea of ``Demonstrative Science'', which we may think of as Aristotle's replacement for Plato's ``real'' world of ideal forms.
It connects with Plato in this area because the two are both concerned with ``reality'', though different ideas on the nature of reality. and because both of these provide a body of truths obtainable by deduction.

Two differences may be noted.
Aristotle provides much greater (unprecedented) detail on the process of deduction.
This appears in Aristotle's ``syllogistic'', the first ever approach to a formal deductive system.
Unfortunately, Aristotle's deductive logic is inadequate for any non-trivlal application, so if we use this to delimit the scope of logical truth then we have a concept far from the notion of logical truth to be found in the triple-dichotomy.
This is a recurring difficulty in the history of the concept.
If the a priori or analyticity are thought of ``proof theoretically'', i.e. as defined by what can be formally derived, then for most of our historical narrative it will be narrowly scoped.

A second area of relevent divergence between Plato and Aristotle is in the nature of the premises from which deductions may proceed.
In Plato, our knowledge of the definitions of the concepts which inhabit the world of forms comes from anamnesis.
Anamnesis refers to the memory possessed by immortal souls from previous incarnations.
Despite this implausible account of our knowledge of definitions, we still have it that our knowledge of the world of ideal forms is analytic, a prioir and necessary.
In Aristotle's demonstrative science, the source of the ``first principles'' is different, but more importantly, the knowledge is of first principles of the various sciences, and it seems doubtful that such first principles can be just definitions of scientific concepts, and we may fear that such principles and the conclusions drawn from them should be considered a posteriori, synthetic and contingent.

On this basis the apparent influence of the idea of demonstrative proof in David Hume's anticipation of the triple dichotomy in his ``fork'' is remarkable


\subsection{Leibniz}



\subsubsection{Conceptual Containment Suffices}

A part of Kant account of the concept of analyticity (which is is credited with having introduced, though I'm not sure he did much more than chose the word to attach to an idea present in Leibniz and Hume) is the assertion that a sentence is analytic if the predicate is contained in the subject.

This seems to entail that all analytic sentences are in Aristotelian subject-predicate form, and this leads many to the belief that later authors, e.g. Frege, had broader concepts of analyticity.

Of course, Kant did deny the analyticity of arithmetic whereas Frege asserted it.
The question is, were they talking at cross purposes (as we might say if their
disagreement was covertly about the meaning of the term ``analytic''), or did they
have a substantive disagreement concerning the extension of the term whilst having
a common understanding of its meaning.

My purpose here is to offer an argument to the effect that ``conceptual containment'' does
provide a reasonable informal account of the notion of analyticity in its broadest sense
(even that of Carnap, which is as broad as it gets), rather than the kind of narrow
conception of analyticity in which analyticity is confined to rather trivial tautologies.

Even though not all sentences are of subject-predicate form (a fact well known to Kant)
they are all logically equivalent to sentences in subject predicate form.
