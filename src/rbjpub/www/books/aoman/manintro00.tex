\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

This extended essay is presented as a manifesto because it contains some ideas about what might be done to improve the world.
Its not a {\it political} manifesto, anti-political, or at least apolitical.  
More than that, it consists of some ideas on how you might find a way of life which helps to make the world the way you would like it to be.

I'm a thinker rather than a doer, so this essay is a fantasy about how ideas might change the world.
I present my own view of the world, which is unlikely to be yours, even if you make your way through to the end.
But that's OK, I expect everyone to have their own view, and that we progress by their exchange.

I'm going to start out by presenting the first philosophical ideas which I can remember having.
Not because these are particularly original or profound, but because the form the base on which my present world view has gradually been constructed over many years, and so it will make it easy to present the whole picture by beginning with them.

These first ideas are elements of naive practical philosophy.
Naive in the sense that they are arrived at just by thinking about certain problems, rather than by reading about what others have said about such problems.
Practical in the sense that they are problems which impacted my life, to which I seemed to need to know the answer.
