\section{Anarchism}\label{Anarchism}

Anarchism is a relatively recent family of political philosophies.
The title of this manifesto comes from one of the distinguished anarchist thinkers, Proudhon.

Anarchism as a political doctrine is the idea that the state should be abolished.

Alternatively anarchism may be characterised as an abhorrence of coercion.
