\paragraph{the sequel}

Around these inauspicious beginnings this manifesto, with its revolutionary pretensions, is woven.

My first steps will be to elaborate on my {\it personal anarchism} partly by reference to the two systems of ideas closest to them.
These are {\it anarchism} in its more common sense as a modern western political (or anti-political) philosophical position, and the ancient Chinese philosophy or religion known in the west as {\it Tao}.
After this elaboration we find that my anarchism has transmuted into its opposite, which I called {\it rationalism}.

The rest of the manifesto is then a sketch of how this notion of rationalism can be elaborated, the elaboration which is the purpose of the book for which this manifesto is a prospectus.
