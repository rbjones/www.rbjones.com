\section{The State}\label{State}

For many anarchists the abolition of the state is the primary goal, the state being considered {\it essentially} and grossly coercive.
So far we have been more concerned with the transforming of society by the adoption of collaborative rather than coercive methods of organisation, we have focused on doing more by cooperation rather than eliminating coercion.

Hard core anarchists may suspect us of being minarchists (admitting a minmal state) or anarcho-capitalists.
Briefly my view on these is as follows.
I do not myself have a definite opinion on whether the state should ultimately disappear altogether.
I am not keen on the anarcho-capitalist scheme for private corporations to provide security services, but I would have no problem with security services being provided by non-profit entities the basic services being free for all.
The size of the non-profit sector in my conception is considerable, and this is the main difference between my anarchism and that of the anarcho-capitalists.
