\chapter{Values and Behaviour}\label{Values}

It is convenient in the utopian enterprise, and in ``utopian philosophy'' more generally, to begin with a conception of choice in which the options are first laid out and then a choice among them is made by evaluating the alternatives against some value system to determine which is the best.

In this chapter belongs an enunciation of the value system which would enable us to choose from among our possible futures that one which we will call utopia and strive to realise.
