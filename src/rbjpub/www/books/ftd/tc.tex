\section{Truth Conditions and Necessity}\label{TruthConditionsAndNecessity}

The ideas central to this book cannot clearly be expressed without the use of a number of technical terms.
One of the most fundanental is the idea of `truth conditions', which is not a complex idea, but deserves careful explanation.

Though Ludwig Wittgensein has made much in his philosophy of the diverse ways in which language works, the narrower conception of language from which he saw his ideas diverging is particularly important in this work.
To treat seriously of this kind of language does not require us to deny that language nay sometimes have a different character, or to think those other kinds or uses of language unimportant.

The language which is of particular importance to us here can reasonably be called \emph{propositional language}, because in it we are able to express \emph{propositions}, which we normally do using \emph{indicative sentences}.
A proposition is used to convey explicit information on some topic.
It does so by having a definite meaning, which is understood by both the person who writes (or speaks) the sentence and by the person reading what he has written.
Knowing the meaning of a sentence, or understanding the proposition it expresses, consists in understanding under what circumstances the proposition (and the sentence expressing it) holds true, and under what circumstances it is false.
Asserting the proposition then communicates that those conditions under which it is false do not obtain, and that the circumstances at hand are among those for which the proosition is held to be true according to ts accepted meaning.

The meaning of the word `meaning' is not straightforward to completely or precisely elaborate, and for natural languages is likely to have many aspects which are not relevant to its use for purely propositional reasoning.
For our purposes, only one aspect of what might be included in the meaning of propositional language is significant, and that is the truth conditions of the proposition expressed (taking into account any context necessary to disambiguate any particular assertion).
A systematic account of the truth conditions of the propositions expressible in some language as its `truth conditional semantics'.

To give a full account of the truth conditions of some language there are some further complications which warrant mention in this context.
The first is context sensitivity.
This is particularly important for natural languages, in which many word are inhrently relational, and context is used to understant relative to what standard they are to be understood.
`Large' is a typical example.
To assert that something is large, has a meaning which is sensitive to what it is that is alleged to be large, and may be sensitive to other things as well.
A large spider is likely to be much smaller than a large, or even a small elephant, and a large rocket ignited at home on Bonfire night will be very much smaller than even the smallest rocket for extraterrestrial transport.

We now come to the term `necessary' when this is used as a technical term in philosophy.

A proposition is necessary if its truth conditions are trivial in the sense that in every conceivable circumstance it is true, in no circumstance is it false,
Alternatively we might say, that a proposition is necessary if under no circumstance is it false, in other words, if it is not possible for it to be false,

In these words we have connected necessity and possibility.
The two are interdefinable, since we could just as well have defined `possible' by saying that a sentence is possibly true if its negation is not necessarily true.

We may therefore define necessity in terms of possibility, or vice-versa, but not both,
We will stick to the former.
What we then say about possibility will then determine the notion of necessity.

There are multiple kinds of necessity.
We will consider three:

\begin{enumerate}
\item logical necessity
\item set theoretic necessity
\item metaphysical necessity
\item physical necessity
\end{enumerate}
