\section{Abstract Semantics}\label{AbstractSemantics}

To underpin and progress beyond the idea that descriptive or objective propositions fall in two principal kinds according to their \emph{meaning}, it is desirable to establish methods whereby meaning may be made precise and unambiguous and to counter negative dogmatism about semantics with a more nuanced position.

It is my purpose here to say something about the role of abstract semantics in metaphysical positivism, to describe the \emph{problem of regress} in abstract semantics, and to sketch an approach to the resolution of that problem.
