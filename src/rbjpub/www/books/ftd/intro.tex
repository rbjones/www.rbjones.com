\chapter{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

Three centuries ago the philosopher, logician, mathematician, scientist and engineer Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz conceived, as a young man, a grand project, so far ahead of its time that no-one has yet come close to realising it.
The principal elements his project were:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \emph{universal formal language} in which all scientific knowledge might be expressed.
\item An \emph{encyclopedia} of science formalised in that language.
\item A \emph{calculus} or algorithm for answering question expressed in that language.
\item Mechanical \emph{calculators}.
\end{itemize}

He devoted considerable energy to progressing these ideas.
But his ideas were pie in the sky, there was no hope of success.

Since then many important developments have taken place in philosophy, logic, and information technology, and most of the now known impediments to the realisation of something close to his dream have now been surmounted.

Today it is natural to think that computers solve the mechanical side of the project, and that the rest of the project is just software of various kinds.
Though Leibniz did work on the hardware, his main interest was in the software, and his approach to this was philosophical and logical.
This is at once an information technology project and philosophical research.
To engineer a cognitive agent, to build something which has or can acquire knowledge, and can reason from that knowledge to solve problems, can only be done in the context of a suitable philosophical framework.
If you want to start such a project from scratch, then you may have to spend some time in philosophical groundwork.
At its most abstract, architectural design for cognitive artifacts is philosophy.

The kind of philosophy required to underpin such a project is not peicemeal philosophical analysis, it is a systematic philosophical synthesis, and it is the aim of this book to undertake such a synthesis, in such a way that its relationship with the engineering of a certain kind of intelligent artifact is made clear.
The engineering enterprise I call here ``the project'', and the philosophy is intended to underpin that project and to constitute its earliest most abstract stages.

It is therefore intended to present by stages together,
\begin{itemize}
\item a conception of an engineering project one of whose goals is the automation of engineering design (the aims of the project),
\item some relatively abstract ideas on how that project can be organised and implemented (some architectural design)
\item a philosophical framework in the context of which the project aims and the proposed architecture can be described and in which the reasons for believing that the architecture will achieve the aims can be articulated.
\end{itemize}

The first stage of this, in Chapter 2, is to give the next stage of detail in describing the project, the aims and the architecture. 
This is presented by starting with an account of Leibniz's project, tracing the history of the ideas from the $17^{th}$ through to the $21^{st}$ century, and then offering a revised conception of such a project for the $21^{st}$.

The philosophical side of this history ends in debacle.
The last major philosophical proponent of a significant fragment of the Leibnizian enterprise was Rudolf Carnap in whose philosophy the formalisation of science had a central place.
In mid $20^{th}$ century, fundamental philosophical ideas with a key place in Carnap's philosophy were repudiated by W.V.Quine.
In particular, the analytic/synthetic distinction, subject to continuous critique by Quine since his first exposure to Carnap's philosophy, was given a full blooded and uncompromising repudiation in Quine's influential ``Two Dogmas of Empiricism''.
Though not aligning himself with Quine on the analytic/synthetic dichotomy Saul Kripke then teased apart the triumvirate of concepts which had been identified by Carnap (analyticity, necessity and the \emph{a priori}), allowing Kripke to inaugurate a new kind of metaphysics, and set analytic philosophy on a new track fundamentally at odds with the philosophy of Carnap.
Thus Kripke contributed to the subsequent widely held view that the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap (sometimes known as \emph{Logical Positivism}) had been decisively refuted as a result of technical advances by two of the most highly competent and respected philosopher-logicians of the period.

The philosophical framework I offer here is closer to the philosophy of Carnap than to that of any other philosopher, and it is therefore necessary in Chapter 3 to repair some of the damage done to this point of view.
Chapter 3 considers the status of these three dichotomies, the distinctions between analytic and synthetic, between necessity and contingency, and that between the \emph{a priori} and the \emph{a posteriori}.
Though not always with this vocabulary, similar distinctions have been talked of throughout almost the entire history of western philosophy.
Through this history one can see both a gradual refinement of these concepts and also reversals.
I therefore lightly trace this history showing how Carnap's understanding of these dichotomies was reached, and then review and respond to some of the modern criticisms which are still held by many to be decisive against Carnap.
In this chapter I argue that the refutation of Carnap on these matters is one more demonstration of the contrast between the rigour of mathematics and that of philosophy.
An illustration, I might say, of the \emph{irrationality} of philosophy.

Carnap's philosophy had been intended to provide a way forward for philosophy to the achievement of standards of rigour comparable to those of mathematics (an ideal which has been held by many philosophers over the last 2500 years), but his programme had been defeated, illustrating  just those defects that he sought to remedy.
To reinstate this idea I sketch another historical thread in Chapter 4.
This is a history of rigour in mathematics and in philosophy.
It is a history also of those philosophers who have percieved the rational deficit in philosophy, or in the search for knowledge more generally, of the \emph{sceptics} of ancient Greece, and of the more modern tradition of \emph{positivism} consisting of a kind of mitigated or constructive scepticism in which high standards of rigour are articulated for both \emph{a priori} and \emph{a posteriori} sciences.

There is an intimate mutual dependency between the philosophical ideas which are at stake and the automation of reason.
The philosophy provides a context in which an approach to the automation of reason and its applications can be understood.
It also promotes methods, capable of making philosophy and empirical science deductively rigorous, whose practical feasibility depends upon advances in the automation of reason.

Having outlined the broader philosophical context, Chapter 5 then looks in greater detail at the philosophies of Leibniz and Carnap, principally on those aspects most significant for their formalisation projects.
The aim here is to make clear the relationship between the philosophical ideas and these projects.
Chapter 6 considers related research and development which has taken place in Computer Science and other disciplines since the formulation of Carnap's ideas, and I then begin to put together a new philosophical framework offered as progressing the ideas of Leibniz and Carnap, toghether with a new conception of the project.
