I am at present working towards a book intended for publication as a print on demand
paperback provisionally entitled "Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason".
<p/>
This section provide access to drafts of the book in various forms and to
other related materials.

<subsec title="Presentations of The Book">
<p>
Drafts of the book are available online as HTML and A4 two column PDF.
The finished book will be published (print on demand) as a 8" x 5.25" single column paperback.
A link for buying the book from Amazon will be included if and when it appears.
Of course, the material is copyright.
You may read the HTML drafts online, or download the PDF to read, but you may not redistribute in any way.
