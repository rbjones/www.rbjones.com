I am at present working towards a book intended for publication as a print on demand
paperback provisionally entitled "Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason".
<p/>
This section provide access to drafts of the book in various forms and to
other related materials.

The formats of drafts available online are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/www/books/ftd/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/www/books/ftd/ftdpam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>
</ul>
The finished book will be published (print on demand) as a 8" x 5.25" single column paperback.
A link for buying the book from Amazon will be included if and when it appears.
Of course, the material is copyright.
