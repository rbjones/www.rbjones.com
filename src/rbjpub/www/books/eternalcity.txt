I think we may be in for a burst of chatter in our little gaggle of blogs around Carnap and Grice.

By way of background I am still trying to find a way to bring into the

twentieth century a form of positivism to my taste, in book form.

This may be thought of as one approach to the fantasised reconciliation

between Carnap and Grice which is for me "The City of Eternal Truth".

My last approach to this was half a book entitled "Positive philosophy and the Automation of Reason", which has laid fallow for a year waiting to be resumed or replaced.

After a few months break from philosophy I decided on replacement by

a "Manifesto of Positive Philosophy", being a more direct and concise attack

on a broader field, which I think of as a fuller contribution to that Eternal City.

 

A period of further Carnapian studies is therefore not entirely inappropriate

for me, and this workshop in Norwich on Carnap is a good catalyst to draw

me quickly in.

 

Here are a few thoughts about how the principle topics to be addressed connect

with out approach to "The Eternal City".

 

The second of the talks, concerning "the Dispute between Ideal and Ordinary Language Approaches" hits the most knotty of the problems which confront

an attempt to reconcile Carnap and Grice.  More problematic even (in my view)

than the question of the status of metaphysics (on which Carnap, despite his

widely quoted youthful hyperbole, seems to me rather soft).

 

 The third of the talks, which focuses on the differences between Carnap and Quine on logic is of interest also in relation to Grice.  Where would Carnap

fall in relation to this?
