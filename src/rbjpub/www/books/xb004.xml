A rather elaborate scheme for the presentation of Positive Philosophy.

<p>
The structure described here arose from a digression in my work on the book "Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason".
In that book there is a chapter which is intended to sketch the history of the analytic/sythetic and related dichotomies.
When I came to putting some substance into that chapter I felt that I needed to get a better understanding of the philosophy of Aristotle.
I thought it might help if I had a hard copy of Aristotle's Organon, his works on logic, and looked for a single volume at a reasonable price containing the whole.
What I found didn't look very good, and it occurred to me that I could do better myself.
