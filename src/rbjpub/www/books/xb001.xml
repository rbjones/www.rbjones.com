<section title="Introduction">
<abstract>
The three books consist of a short informal exposition and a more extended
exposition of the analytic method in application to problems of analytical
exegesis bearing upon the history of concepts and problems which underpin the method.

<subsec title="Some History">
<p>
At the beginning of 2009 I thought to write a monograph on "The Fundamental Triple-Dichotomy".
This project evolved during the year, first into more broadly conceived "book" on "Metaphysical Positivism".
To this was added a companion project, at first "A Formal History of Philosophical Logio", the name shifting with my ideas and ending the year as "An Analytic History of Philosophical Analysis".
</p><p>
At the beginning of 2010 I decided to scrap these projects (which had evolved considerably in their conception, but not progressed significantly in their execution) and start afresh.
I started up a new project called "The HOT Philosophy Project", but in no time at all I realised that, even though this might take the limelight over 2010, it would not encompass all that I still wanted to do in the original projects.
So I decided to keep them, or something similar.
</p><p>
I had originally intended "The Fundamental Triple-Dichotomy" and then its sucessor "Metaphysical Positivism" to contain quite a lot of historical material.
Under the new structure this kind of material is split between "The HOT Philosophy Project" (which includes some relevant intellectual autobiography and some history essential to understanding the ideas) and "The Analytic History..." (which is primarily historical), leaving "Metaphysical Positivism" as a pure exposition of a kind of analytic philosophy.
This would, I thought, be too narrow a scope, so I decided to make it a fuller account of my philosophy and call it "Positive Philosophy".
This would have a part on the purely analytic of the philosophy, for which I would continue to use the name "Metaphysical Positivism".
</p><p>
So that's where I am now, with three books under consideration.
HOT philosophy is the one which is supposed to move fast.
The Analytic history is likely to proceed at snails pace, and may never emerge into print, though I hope there will be some parts which are worth looking at in reasonable timescales.
Not sure how "Positive Philosophy" will work out, I haven't thought much about that one yet.
</p>
</subsec>

<subsec title="The Presentation of Metaphysical Positivism">
<p>
Our account of this philosophy falls into three parts.
</p><p>
The first two parts connect Metaphysical Positivism with its philosophical
roots by explaining how it first into the history of positivism and that of
metaphysics (which despite the recent coinage of "positivism" both extend back
through millenia).
</p><p>
Metaphysical positivism at the same time takes to their logical conclusion
certain idea key to positivism, as well as moderating features of positivism
most antagonistic to metaphysics.
</p><p>
The remaining part of the exposition hangs around a method of logical analysis.
The method itself is intended to enable rigour in the deductive parts of
philosophy, and to make rigourous analytic historical exegesis.
It is not confined to philosophy, but is intended for application wherever
deductive arguments may be thought beneficial.
</p><p>
An extended and comprehensive presentation of this method, embracing its
fundamental philosophical underpinnings and technical and philosophical
accounts of the way in which the method may be applied in metaphysics, analytic
philosophy, logic, mathematics, science and engineering provides the framework
for a broad coverage of the principles of Metaphysical Positivism.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="The Analytic Method applied to Historical Exegesis">
<p>
This is intended to be a collection of formal models illustrating the
application of the method of formal logical analysis to historical exegisis.
</p><p>
It is intended both to explain and illustrate in action that method, but also
to trace the history of the philosophical and logical ideas which underpin the
method.
</p><p>
In this the most crucial concept whose history is traced is that of logical
truth (in that broad sense which was identified by Rudolf Carnap with the concept of
analyticity).
</p><p>
The history begins with Plato, and is intended to conclude only when all the
necessary advances which contribute to our method are in place (about 1985).
</p><p>
This is in part an exercise in comparative metaphysics.
Metaphysical Positivism provides our best approximation to a minimal, neutral metaphysical and logical
foundation suitable for conducting the comparison without tainting the systems
under study by the philosophical and logical presuppositions of the analytic method.
</p><p>
This minimal neutral metaphysic is a core feature of Metaphysical Positivism
and a terminus for the history.

<section title="Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason">
<abstract>
I am at present working towards a book intended for publication as a POD
paperback provisionally entitled "Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason".
<p/>
This section provide access to drafts of the book in various forms and to
other related materials.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Presentations of The Book">
<p>
Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
book.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format
you find most convenient.
All except the paperback book format are provided for you to read or download
for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the book, with the sole exception of the paperback format, which will become
available only when the book is deemed complete (-enough for the first edition).
</p><p>
The available formats are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="ftd/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="ftd/ftdpam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>
</ul>
A link for buying the paperback from Amazon will be included if ever the book is completed.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Other Materials">
I have a variety of other material on this topic which I am developing
concurrently with the book.
Some of these provide additional detail and discussion or background, others
present the material in different ways.

<subsec title="Scope of The Book">
The book project began as a monograph project specifically on "Hume's Fork" and it was in trying to provide sufficient context for a proper understanding of the significance of Hume's fork that I was lead into making "Metaphysical Positivism" the headline.
Later I decided that the origins of the philosophy should go into a "HOT philosophy" volume and that other related historical material would go into "An Analytic History of Philosophical Analysis".
A bald (informal) account of the content of Metaphysical Philosophy now feels too small, so I decide to broaden the scope, from the purely analytic "Metaphysical Positivism" to the broader concept of "Positive Philosophy".
Subsequently I revived the project focussing down to the theoretical side (hence back to metaphysical positivism) but connecting this with the automation of reason.
The idea is that metaphysical positivism is presented as a philosophical framework in which a certain approach to the automation of reason could be undertaken.

<subsec title="Discussions">
If you want to discuss any aspect of this work in progress, then you may contact me directly by email (rbj at rbjones.com).
Alternatively, if you want to post to a public forum (e.g. a mailing list or a group) on any matter connected with this work, then if you copy me I may respond either privately or in the forum.
