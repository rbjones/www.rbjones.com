\part{Western Philoosphy}\label{partII}

I have sketched the evolution of life on Earth to the point at which we might expect elementary deductive reasoning to appear.
At this point deduction is a capability, not something of which we have knowledge.
The story will be resumed from the time at which written evidence first suggests deduction to become apparent and deliberate.
This is early in the cultural phenomenon of ancient Greece, about two and a half millennia ago, by comparison with the 4 billion years it took to get that far.

Evolution of the genome is no longer my concern (until we come to consider the future), we are now concerned with cultural evolution, in the growth of knowledge (if we could think it monotonic).
My interest is in the evolution of rationality, deduction, of the relationship between the two.

\chapter{Rationality and Deduction}

It is, so far as we know, in ancient Greece that deduction first comes to play an explicit epistemological role.
Its first successes are in mathematics, here we first see mathematics as a deductive science.

Alongside this we see a transition from theological to metaphysical ways of thinking about the world.
This transition partly concerns the kinds of explanation which are offered, and partly concerns by whom and in what way these explanations originate.
