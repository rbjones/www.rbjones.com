\chapter{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

The core of this book is an exposition of \emph{method}.
The method in question may be characterised as a method of
\emph{logical analysis}, but no great strength should be attached to
the use of the word \emph{analysis} here.
The method is applicable wherever \emph{deduction} may be thought to
be of value, and is primarily a method for ensuring rigour in
deductive reasoning.

Around a brief exposition of method I provide also some philosophical
underpinnings for the method, some discussion of the scope of the
method and some discussion of refinements of the method suitable for
particular kinds of problem or enterprise.

One general domain of application of particular interest here is
philosophy, which also provides the subject matters for a number of
illustrative applications of the method.
