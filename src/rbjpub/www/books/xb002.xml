Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
book.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format
you find most convenient.
All except the paperback book format are provided for you to read or download
for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the book, with the sole exception of the paperback format, which will become
available only when the book is deemed complete (-enough for a first edition).
