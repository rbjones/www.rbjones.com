<section title="HOT Philosophy">
<abstract>
I am at present working towards a book intended for publication as a POD
paperback provisionally entitled "HOT Philosophy".
<p/>
This section provide access to drafts of the book in various forms and to
other related materials.

<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Presentations of The Book">
<p>
Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
book.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format
you find most convenient.
All except the paperback book format are provided for you to read or download
for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the book, with the sole exception of the paperback format, which will become
available only when the book is deemed complete (-enough for the first edition).
</p><p>
The available formats are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="hotp/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="hotp/hotppam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>
</ul>
A link for buying the paperback from Amazon will be included when the book has
been published.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Other Materials">
The book will be an account of philosophy in progress.
This will involve detailed analysis of certain problems, the details of which will not all be included in the book, but will be available as supplementary collateral on the rbjones.com web site.
