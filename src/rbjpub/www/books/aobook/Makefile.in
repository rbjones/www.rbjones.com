# This is the makefile for the "Anarchy is Order" book.
#
# This is a short book intended to be about 60,000 words long.
# It is intended for publication in several forms, which are:
#
# A) small format book (5.25x8 inch) suitable for POD publication via amazon (PDF).
# B) html from A by latex2html for rbjones.com (possibly only while in progress)
# C) format suitable amazon ebook derived from A.
# Its also possible to sell PDF or HTML electronic documents on amazon,
# I shall keep that possibility under review.

# I am trying to leave open the structure of the book in the following way.
# I will identify certain subject matters each of which might form a chapter of the
# book and write it as if they were chapters.
# However, each of these chapters will be broken into sections and each section will
# be in a separate file so that I can if I decide this is best, make a book in which
# the subject areas are threaded through the chapters.

# The files will be named with some system.
# At a fist guess there will be 10 chapters 20 pages on average split into 10 sections.
# That's 200 pages, 100 sections.
# One file for each section plus one extra for each chapter which just contains the title.
# So I will chose a name for each chapter, and add a two digit suffix for the section number.
# It is possible there might be parts.  e.g. practical, theoretical

# I have now decided to have three parts, past present and future.

# Candidate chapter names are:

# intro	Introduction
# autob Autobiographical
# evolu Evolution
# ratio Rationality
# socia Social
# anarc Anarchism
