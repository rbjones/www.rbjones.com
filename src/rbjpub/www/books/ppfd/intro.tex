\chapter{Introduction}

This is the second of two volumes in which a certain ideas which I
call \emph{Positive Philosophy} are presented.
The first volume \cite{rbjb004} is concerned with the
\emph{theoretical} aspects of Positive Philosophy, this volume is
concerned with the \emph{practical} side. 

The distinction between the two corresponds roughly to the distinction
between \emph{matters of fact}, and \emph{judgements of value} (after Hume) or that
between natural and moral philosophy in Aristotle.

The first volume therefore addresses questions in epistemology,
metaphysics and logic, in the philosophy of mathematics, science and
engineering.

This volume is concerned with what might be called personal or
existential matters, with ethics and morality, and with political,
economic, and other social matters.

In both of these volumes I am concerned to connect the philosophy with
what seem to me to be important contemporary issues an understanding
of which may be important for our futures.
In both cases the possible future impacts of information technologies is
a principle concern, particularly the positive opportunities arising.

In the first the theoretical issues are therefore intimately connected
with more practical matters connected with the automation of reason,
to the extent that the epistemology and logic are presented as an
abstract architecture for cognitive cooperation between man and
machine. 

In this volume the ``practical'' philosophy is commected with some of
opportunities and challenges which information technology brings to
the conduct of our lives and the workings of social institutions.
Of these the ways in which individuals are now and will in the future
be able to influence the world around us, both through political and
economic institutions are of particular interest.

The two volumes are intended to be largely independent, and for that
reason I begin this volume with an account of those aspects of the
theoretical philosophy (which I sometimes call ``metaphysical
positivism'') which are most important for an understanding of the
practical philosophy to be considered, and which provide analytic
methods which are here extended for and applied in practical
philosophy. 
I aim in this to give an account which is more compact and focussed,
that the fuller treatment in the previous volume,
which is oriented toward the topics treated here.

Beyond a general discussion of practical philosophy, two areas in
which information technology might enable or impell changes are
explored.

These concern the nature of democracy, and the operation of market
economies, and the ways in which these might enable significant
changes to our conception of democracy and to the freedom and
opportunities for the individual.

The automation of reason is used in the first volume as a way of
focussing an account of a theoretical philosophy.
In this volume an exploration of possible changes in democratic
politics and free market economies serves a similar purpose, providing
a motivation for the preceding account of practical philosophy.
