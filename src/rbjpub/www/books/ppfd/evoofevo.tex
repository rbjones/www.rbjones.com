\chapter{The Evolution of Evolution}\label{EvolutionOfEvolution}

That evolution evolves is important to the story I hope to tell, not least because the story concerns the future, and we are at a point in history which will likely prove to have been a particularly striking transition in the most significant kinds of evolution.

This chapter gives the briefest of sketches of some of the ways in which evolution here on earth has been transformed over the last three billion years, as background for later consideration of how it might change in the next three billion.
