I briefly studied philosophy, in a British University, at a time when there was felt a need to gesture across a gulf which seemed to have opened up in the tradition of Western Philosophy, between the somewhat Anglo-Saxon {\it analytic} tendency ascendent in England from the beginning of the $20^{th}$ Century and an obscurely perceived alternative called ``continental philosophy''.
The boundaries of this divide were not clear to me, never clearly geographical.

By that time, enthusiasm for the purely analytic conception of philosophy  was on the wane, but an antipathy to all-embracing philosophical systems, which might possibly have flown from it, seemed well established and has persisted.

Meanwhile, in that other shadowy realm, matters had been under foot for some time, and continued to develop throughout my now considerable lifetime, bursting into my consciousness belatedly, after I had already conceived of this work, with the protests and riots of anti-capitalism, climate activism the cancel culture of identity politics and the enhanced racial sensitivies exposed by {\em Black Lives Matter}.

No more important time for philosophical reflection could be imagined, for those of us with the inclination and some hope for intellectual space.
