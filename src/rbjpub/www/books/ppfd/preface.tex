My mind is on the future, but the problems of the present have lead me to pay some attention to the past.

This book is the result.
It is the slender outcome of a life of reflection.

On no topic touched do I have impressive qualifications or recognised competence,
but on some I have a measure of esoteric knowledge which finds a place in the more detailed exposition.
I apologise to the many who will find those parts impenetrable, and hope that passing over them will lose some detail but leave the bigger picture intact.

I am of sceptical temper, and perhaps closer to positivism than any other philosophical tendency.
Suspension of belief while reading the book is appropriate.

I have tried to make the introduction tell the whole story while omitting some detail.
Many readers need go no further.
