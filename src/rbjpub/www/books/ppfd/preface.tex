My mind is on the future, but the problems of the present have lead me to pay some attention to the past.

This book is the result.

I apologise to those professional academics in whose areas of expertise I have expressed tendentious opinions.
I could not write without such transgressions.
I can only hope that my own perspective might not be entirely unproductive.

I am of sceptical temper, and perhaps closer to positivism than any other philosophical tendency.
Suspension of belief while reading the book is appropriate, even for those least hostile to its tendencies.

I have tried to make the introduction tell the whole story while omitting some detail.
It may suffice.
