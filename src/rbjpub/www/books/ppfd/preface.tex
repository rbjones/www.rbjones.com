My mind is on the future, but the problems of the present have lead me to pay some attention to the past.

This book is the result.
It is the slender outcome of a life of reflection.

On no topic touched do I have impressive qualifications or recognised competence,
but on some I have a measure of esoteric knowledge which seems important to the story.
I apologise to the many who will find those parts impenetrable, and hope that passing over them will lose some detail but leave the bigger picture intact.

I am of sceptical temper, and perhaps closer to positivism than any other philosophical tendency.
If you read this book in a state of perpetual doubt, you will be in the right place, and it may have accomplished its purpose.
