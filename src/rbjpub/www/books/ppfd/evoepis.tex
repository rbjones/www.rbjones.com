\chapter{Epistemic Evolution}\label{EpistemicEvolution}

In this chapter we look in greater detail at one particular thread in the evolution of evolution, and in the products of that evolution.

Epistemology is the theory of knowledge and is closely coupled with the concept of rationality, not least through the concept of epistemic rationality.
In considering what constitutes rationality whether practical or epistemic, we are engaged in epistemology, for even when we are not considering the kind of propositional knowledge which is concerned in epistemic rationality, there is a kind of operational pracitcal knowledge which is relevant to practical rationality.
