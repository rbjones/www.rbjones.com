<p>
The new deal here is that I use this space (or these spaces, one page between each upload) just to scribble about what I am trying to do.
</p><p>
Things are moving slowly, as usual.
In case because I needed to spend some time getting a clue about what "romanticism" is so that I can take the bits I like and fit them in.
I did this mainly by looking at Isaiah Berlin.
I'm still not quite finished with him but its definitely time to get moving again, on something more creative than scrappy notes.
</p><p>
My first foray on integrating the romantic side involved addressing it via dichotomies at two levels, logic/emotion was one, at a psychological level and I had a problem chosing one at a more social level.
I started under provocation from Gellners book title "Reason and Culture", thinking this would fit.
</p><p>
Now I see that it doesn't.
Gellner's book now seems to me not to be about the reason/romanticism pair but about reason and authorities of certain kinds.
I still don't have Gellner's project properly in my head, but I'm getting some idea of how it differs from mine.
</p><p>
Anyway, the upshot is I just changed from "reason and culture" to "reason and romanticism", and I have in mind something fairly close to the contrast as drawn by Berlin between the enlightenment values and some elements of romanticism.
