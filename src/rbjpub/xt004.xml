A log of changes to RBJones.com (latest first).
The basis for chosing what to mention here is uncertain, but is tentatively that some piece of work has been completed, or more likely, temporarily suspended.

<subsec title="Naive Philosophy" doc="x020" dir="philos">
Scepticism is a philosophical attitude in the context of which all my philosophy takes place.
In my search both for how to make the material on scepticism a better account of the reality of scepticism for me, thinking at the same time about my attempts to get a "romantic" side off the ground, I realised that an important element of romanticism belongs "down here" with the scepticisms rather than "up there" with metaphysical positivism, and after a few awful headings I decided that "Naive Philosphy" would do the trick.
However, I didn't get very far in writing and rewriting this stuff to make it match my present conception of how it should be.

<subsec title="Existential Expressionism" doc="xe001" dir="philos">
I decided to split a bit off my conception of "Existential Positivism" to fit together with theoretical and practical scepticism into "Naive Philosophy".
