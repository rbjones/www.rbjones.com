<abstract>
Links to listings of some of the theories which come with ProofPower, with brief descriptions.
These are the ones used by the theories at RBJones.com, though at present I am not able to convert them all into HTML.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory min" href="min.html">
This theory introduces the primitive vocabulary for this variant of higher order logic.
There are just three constants and three type constructors.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory log" href="log.html">
The definitions of logical constants in terms of the primitive (undefined) constants.
The ones defined are those which are needed to state the axioms.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory init" href="init.html">
The five axioms for the primitive logic.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory misc" href="misc.html">
Miscellaneous low level definitions (local definitions, conditionals, unique existence) and theorems.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory pair" href="pair.html">
The theory of ordered pairs, including Curry and Uncurry.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory %nat%" href="nat.html">
The theory of Natural numbers.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory list" href="list.html">
The theory of lists.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory char" href="char.html">
The theory of characters (of which there are only 256).
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory basic_hol" href="basic_hol.html">
No content, parent is char.
This is the highest point at which a new theory can be attached. 
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory sets" href="sets.html">
The theory of sets.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory one" href="one.html">
A type with just one element.

The theory of disjoint unions.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Theory hol" href="hol.html">
No content, parents are sets, sum and one.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory bin_rel" href="bin_rel.html">
The theory of binary relations.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory %int%" href="int.html">
The theory of integers.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory dyadic" href="dyadic.html">
The theory of dyadic operators.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory orders" href="orders.html">
The theory of orders.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory %real%" href="real.html">
