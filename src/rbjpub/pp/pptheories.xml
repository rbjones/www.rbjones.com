<abstract>
Links to listings of some of the theories which come with ProofPower, with brief descriptions.
These are the ones used by the theories at RBJones.com, though at present I am not able to convert them all into HTML.

<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory min" href="min.html">
This theory introduces the primitive vocabulary for this variant of higher order logic.
There are just three constants and three type constructors.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory log" href="log.html">
The definitions of logical constants in terms of the primitive (undefined) constants.
The ones defined are those which are needed to state the axioms.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory init" href="init.html">
The five axioms for the primitive logic.
</subsec>
</sbcol>

</subsec>
<subsec title="Listing of Theory pair" href="pair.html">
The theory of ordered pairs, including Curry and Uncurry.
</subsec>

<subsec title="Listing of Theory char" href="char.html">
The theory of characters (of which there are only 256).
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory basic_hol" href="basic_hol.html">
No content, parent is char.
This is the highest point at which a new theory can be attached. 
</subsec>
<subsec title="Theory sets">
The theory of sets.
Not yet able to convert.
