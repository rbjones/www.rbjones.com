\section{Prelude}

This is a second exloration of ways of doing abstract mathematics and algebra in ProofPower HOL.
My first approach is in \cite{rbjt039}, an approach by Rob Arthan is in his wrk080 and wrk081.
This second exploration attempts to take into account some of the ideas in Rob Arthan's work, and is also a way of coming to a better understanding of that material.
There are other influences (less easily identified) on what I am attempting here.
These are more fully discussed later.

Further discussion of what might become of this document in the future may be found the postscript (Section \ref{POSTSCRIPT}).

In this document, phrases in coloured text are hyperlinks, like on a web page, which will usually get you to another part of this document (the blue parts, the contents list, page numbers in the Index) but sometimes take you (the red bits) somewhere altogether different (if you happen to be online) like \href{http://rbjones.com/rbjpub/pp/doc/t044.pdf}{online copy of this document}.
