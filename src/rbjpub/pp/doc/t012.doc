\begin{abstract}
This document provides facilities for automatic reasoning based on chaining.
They are intended to be similar in capability to refutation proof procedures such as resolution or semantic tableau, but in order to fit in better with interactive proof in ProofPower are not refutation oriented.
The main target is a backchaining facility which searches for a proof of the conclusion of the current goal from premises and rules drawn from the assumptions and elsewhere, but as far as possible the chaining support is designed to also be applicable for forward chaining.

The facilities provided here are intended to work with a rule set held in a unifying term net and to provide efficient elaboration of chains of inference constructed by composing applications of rules made to match by unification.

The interface is intended to be consistent with matching the premises of a rule with the conclusions of other rules at the time when the rule base is established or augmented, or with unification on demand combined with cacheing, or by pure unification on demand.

The design of the data structures involved is therefore required to permit the rule base software to anticipate what unifications will be required with minimal prejudice to the search strategy or other aspects of the implementation of the chaining inference facility.

The design of the data structures involved is therefore required to permit the rule base software to anticipate what unifications will be required with minimal prejudice to the search strategy or other aspects of the implementation of the chaining inference facility.

I did think of trying to make the rule base independent of whether forward or backward chaining was envisaged, but I decided against.
