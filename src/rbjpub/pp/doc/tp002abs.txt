the Automation of Deduction -
a multidisciplinary perspective

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a Philosopher, a Logician, a Mathematician, a Scientist, Engineer and inventor.

His conceptions of a universal language and calculus of reasoning have helped inspire Frege's 
work on the Begriffschrift, Russell's on Principia Mathematica, 
and contemporary work in Computer Science, such as the 
"Calculemus" project.

This talk will begin by discussing how Leibniz's grand project 
might be adapted to the 21st century, and then surveying in that 
context a number of problem areas of particular interest to the 
speaker.  These are typically areas in which there is fruitful 
interaction between philosophical and technical questions, and 
in which some progress has been made by formal work with 
ProofPower and/or Isabelle.
