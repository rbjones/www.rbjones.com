the Automation of Deduction -
a multidisciplinary perspective

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a Philosopher, a Logician,
a Mathematician, Scientist and Engineer.

His conceptions of a universal language and calculus of
reasoning have helped inspire Frege's work on the Begriffschrift,
Russell's on Principia Mathematica, and contemporary work
in Computer Science, such as the "Calculemus" project.

In the context of Leibniz's grand project I will first enumerate
some philosophical principles endemic to the Cambridge ARG,
(implicit in the methods and/or explicit in some of
the publications of the ARG).

Some consequences of these philosophical principles for the
architecture of globally distributed automation of deduction
will then be considered, making use of a formal model in
Isabelle-HOL.  A central concern is the articulation of a
notion of soundness appropriate to this context.

These are typically areas in which there is fruitful 
interaction between philosophical and technical questions, and 
in which some progress has been made by formal work with 
ProofPower and/or Isabelle.
