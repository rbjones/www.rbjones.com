From QED to X-Logic, following the lead of Leibniz

Was the QED project for the formalisation of mathematics too ambitious?
Leibniz, whose conception of a universal language and calculus of reasoning
preceded QED by 300 years, would have thought it faint-hearted,
the two most difficult problems in realising his grander vision having been
resolved by the revolution in modern logic and the invention of
the electronic digital computer.

"X-Logic" is a contemporary interpretation of Leibniz's project.
Like the original, it is a multi-disciplinary enterprise, straddling
the boundaries between philosophy, logic, computing, and science.

In this talk after introducing Leibniz and his project, I will enumerate
some philosophical principles endemic to the Cambridge Automated Reasoning
Group (implicit in the methods and/or explicit in some of the publications
of the ARG).
Some consequences of these philosophical principles for an architecture
for globally distributed, linguistically pluralistic, automated deduction
will then be considered, making use of a formal model in Isabelle-HOL.

At this level inference takes place between documents, which are understood
as complex propositions, and may be in any language which has a
well-defined abstract semantics. The notion of proof is generalised
to encompass all correct computation relative to program specifications
expressed in terms of the languages of documents. Assurance of the truth
of propositions thus proven is managed by the qualification of judgements
with a list of those authorities upon whose infallibility certainty in the
content of the judgement rests.

A central concern is the articulation of a notion of soundness appropriate
to this context. A manner of resolving the foundational problem of semantic
regress, and that of a final resort on matters of consistency. will be
touched upon.
