<abstract>
This directory contains a collection of fragments of work using ProofPower in LaTeX documents converted to PDF for viewing.
They are mainly philosophically motivated, but doing anything formally requires a lot of purely technical infrastructure, and so the philosophical connection may not be obvious.
Listed in roughly inverse chronological order of document creation, left column most recent.
