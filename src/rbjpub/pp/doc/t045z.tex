\section{Theories Listed using aliases}\label{TheoryListings}

Note that aliases are used in the theory listings when printing the substance of definitions, and it may therefore appear as if an existing constant is being defined (if the new constant was then give that name as an alias).
On the left of the definition the keys (which may be used to retrieve the definitions) are the actual names of the constants defined, unaffected by the use of aliases.

\section{Theories Listed withouth using aliases}\label{TheoryListingsWithoutAliases}

In some cases aliasing does make it more difficult to understand the material, and the theories are therefore listed again without aliases in case this should prove necessary for the reader to disambiguate the content.

The effect is of a greater clutter of disambiguating subscripts or superscripts which make explicit the variant of a concept used at any point in the theory.
