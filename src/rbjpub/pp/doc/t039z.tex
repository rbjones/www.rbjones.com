\section{Postscript}\label{POSTSCRIPT}

My main near term objective for this document is to supply the necessary lattice theory for X-Logic.

For this purpose I need to be able to reason about quotient lattices, and therefore am thinking in terms of a general quotient construction in universal algebra applied in the lattice theory.

However, as a tester (bearing in mind how slowly I move with this kind of material), I am proving that the composition of homomorphisms is a homomorphism (in universal algebra) and applying that to Lattice theory.
The universal result is proven, and it remains to be seen how straigtforward it will be to apply it to lattices.
