\section{Postscript}\label{POSTSCRIPT}

These are the kinds of thing which {\it might} happen in future issues of this document:

\begin{itemize}
\item Much more detailed discussion and jusification of the method of formalisation, probably split between here and an earlier chapter of the first volume.
\item A full discussion of the philosophical issues.
\item It would probably be better to rework with a different semantics, with type 'a+'b+'c, separate disjuncts for designating, non-designating and non-correlating expressions, to allow for distinct non-existents and descriptions. 
\end{itemize}
