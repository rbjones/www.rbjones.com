\section{Postscript}\label{POSTSCRIPT}

These are the kinds of thing which {\it might} happen in future issues of this document:

\begin{itemize}
\item Much more detailed discussion and jusification of the method of formalisation, probably split between here and an earlier chapter of the first volume.
\item A detailed presentation of the deductive system of Q illustrated by theorems in {\Product}.
\item A full discussion of all the ancillary topics such as identity, names and descriptions.
\end{itemize}
