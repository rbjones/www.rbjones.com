\section{INTRODUCTION}

This document forms a part of a foundational architecture.

In this introduction I will say a few words about the architecture and how this document fits into it, sufficient to give some motivation for the choices I have made here,

The architecture addresses descriptive languages and their use in deductive reasoning.
Such languages and methods are seen as enabling, especially when appropriately supported by digital information processing, advances in the ways in which various important objectives may be realised.

To reason deductively using some language, it is important that the language has a definite abstract semantics, and this is best realised by defining suitable languages using a formal semantics.
Unfortunately, a semantic regress results.

Multiple strategems are advocated for the termination of semantic regress.
We are concerned here with just one of these.
This involves termination of formal semantic regress in an informal semantics, which is itself primarily vested in an abstract ontology.

We therefore present:

\begin{itemize}
\item an informal description of an abstract ontology
\item an inforaml account of the truth conditions of languages suitable for talking and reasoning about this ontology
\item an approximation to this language as a computer supported formalised axiomatic theory
\end{itemize}

\section{ONTOLOGY}

The aim is for a universal abstract ontology.
That is, one to which any other kind of abstract ontology may be reduced.
This is to provide the subject matter for languages which may be universal in senses to be discussed.

It is seems natural, for many involved in formal semantics, to regard set theory as a metalanguage of last resort, in which the formal semantics of any other language might be given.
To be sure negative results on definability are interpreted as forcing us to consider set theories as languages which come in a heirarchy of strengths, and only the family of languages rather than any particular member of that family has any hope of being universal.
This does not exhaust the objections which can be raised against the possibility that set theory (or any other language) can be universal.

\subsection{Semantic Universality}

The practical utility of a foundation for abstract semantics does not rest on its being universal, but it is nevertheless an interesting possibility.

The kind of universality concerned here is universality for defining abstract semantics.
A universal language in this sense would be one in which the semantics of any other language could be rendered.
To make this notion of unversality precise you would have to make precise the relevant notion of ``language'' concerned and that of ``semantics''.
I know of no single contender for this.

It may be worth mentioning a couple of examples.

It is conventional wisdom that the truth predicate of a lsnguage cannot be defined in that language.
This is certainly demonstrable for first order arithmetic, via formalisation of epeminides' paradox.
If this could be generalised, it would yield a negative result on the possibility of a universal language for abstract semantics, and it is sometimes construed as doing so.

\subsection{Well-Founded Collections}

{\quote
A well-founded set is any definite collection of well-founded sets. 
}

This is intended as an inductive definition, and hence that only those collections whose well-foundedness follows from this definition are well-founded sets.
The term ``definite'' is important, since without some such qualification the definition would yield a contradiction, since the collection of well-founded sets which it defines would then be itself a well-founded set, and would hence not be well-founded.

This tells us that the notion of well-founded set is essentially open ended, that the formation of well-founded sets never comes to an end, that the well-founded sets do not form a definite collection.
The meaning of definite is intended here to be very weak.
We do require a set to be a definite collection in the sense that every possible member of the set either is or is not a member. 
This is what we need for membership to be encapsulated in a boolean relationship.
The concept of well-founded set could be made definite by giving a stronger meaning to definite in the above definition, e.g. by incorporating a limit on the size or rank of a definite set.
But I know of no natural ans intuitively plausible strengthening, limitations of size and rank seem quite arbitrary.

\section{WELL-FOUNDED RELATIONS}

This is a transcription of the treatment of well-foundedness on which "galactic" set theory was based (from rbjpub/pp/x002.xml).

One of the principle well-founded relations of interest in this application is $‰g$, which has type

=GFT
”GS ­ GS ­ BOOL®
=TEX

so I would like a version of "well-founded" which has type:

=GFT
”('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL®
=TEX

\subsubsection{The Theory wf\_relp}

The new theory is first created, together with a proof context which we will build up as we develop the theory.

\subsection{Well-Founded Relations}

Definition of well-founded and transitive-well-founded and proof that the transitive closure of a well-founded relation is transitive-well-founded.

¹HOLCONST
well_founded: ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL
÷
µ r ·
 well_founded r ¤ µ s · (µ x · (µ y · r y x ´ s y) ´ s x) ´ µ x · s x
°

¹HOLCONST
twfp: ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL
÷
µ r ·
 twfp r ¤ well_founded r ± trans r
°

The first thing I need to prove here is that the transitive closure of a well-founded relation is also well-founded.
This provides a form of induction with a stronger induction hypothesis.
Naturally we would expect this to be proven inductively and the question is therefore what property to use in the inductive proof, the observation that the transitive closure of a relation is well-founded is not explicitly the ascription of a property to the field of the relation.
The obvious method is to relativise the required result to the transitive closure of a set, giving a property of sets, and then to prove that this property is hereditary if the relation is well-founded.

Now we prove that if the transitive closure of a relation is well-founded then so must be the relation.

=SML
set_goal([], ¬µr· well_founded (tc r) ´ well_founded r®);
a (rewrite_tac [get_spec ¬well_founded®]

a (spec_nth_asm_tac 2 ¬s®);

a (all_asm_fc_tac [tc_incr_thm]);
a (all_asm_fc_tac []);

a (asm_rewrite_tac[]);
val tc_wf_wf_thm = save_pop_thm "tc_wf_wf_thm";

a (asm_rewrite_tac [get_spec ¬twfp®, tran_tc_thm]);
val tc_wf_twf_thm = save_pop_thm "tc_wf_twf_thm";
=TEX
}%ignore

We here define a general tactic for performing induction using some well-founded relation.
The following function (I think these things are called "THM-TACTICAL"s) must be given a theorem which asserts that some relation is well-founded, and then a THM-TACTIC (which determines what is done with the induction assumption), and then a term which is the variable to induct over, and will then facilitate an inductive proof of the current goal using that theorem.

=SML
fun WF_INDUCTION_T (thm : THM) (ttac : THM -> TACTIC) : TERM -> TACTIC =
(	let	fun bad_thm thm = thm_fail "WF_INDUCTION_T" 29021 [thm];
		val (wf, r) = (dest_app (concl thm))
			handle Fail _ => bad_thm thm;
		val sthm = µ_elim r tcwf_lemma2
			handle Fail _ => bad_thm thm;
		val ithm = ´_elim sthm thm
			handle Fail _ => bad_thm thm;
	in GEN_INDUCTION_T ithm ttac
	end
);
=TEX

And now we make a tactic out of that (basically by saying "strip the induction hypothesis into the assumptions").

=SML
fun wf_induction_tac (thm : THM) : TERM -> TACTIC = (
	let	val ttac = (WF_INDUCTION_T thm strip_asm_tac)
			handle ex => reraise ex "wf_induction_tac";
	in
	fn tm =>
	let	val tac = (ttac tm) handle ex => reraise ex "wf_induction_tac";
	in	fn gl => ((tac gl) handle ex => reraise ex "wf_induction_tac")
	end
	end
);
=TEX

\subsubsection{Well-foundedness and Induction}

The following proof shows how the above induction tactic can be used.
The theorem can be paraphrased loosely along the lines that there are no bottomless descending chains in a well-founded relation.
We think of a bottomless descending chain as a non-empty set (represented by a property called "p") every element of which is preceded by an element under the transitive closure of r.

\subsubsection{Bottomless Pits and Minimal Elements}

The following theorem states something like that if there are no unending downward chains then every "set" has a minimal element.

A second order version with the weaker bottomless pits can be formulated as follows:

=SML
set_goal([], ¬µr·(µx· ³¶p v· p v ± µy· p y ´ ¶z· p z ± r z y)
	´ µp· (¶y· p y) ´ ¶z· p z ± ³¶v· r v z ± p v®);
a contr_tac;
a (DROP_NTH_ASM_T 3 ante_tac

a (REPEAT strip_tac);
a (spec_nth_asm_tac 2 ¬y'®);
a (¶_tac ¬v® THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]);
val nochain_min_thm2 = save_pop_thm "nochain_min_thm2";

It follows that all non-empty collections of predecessors under a well-founded relation have minimal elements.

=SML
set_goal([], ¬µr· well_founded r ´ µx· (¶y· r y x) ´ ¶z· r z x ± ³¶v· r v z ± r v x®);

The main part of this is the proof that functionals which are well-founded with respect to some well-founded relation have fixed points.
This done, the operator "fix" is defined, which yields such a fixed point.

\subsection{Respect Theorems}

Some theorems which help to prove that functions respect relations.

\subsubsection{Introduction}

My first applications of the recursion theorem are in set theory, typically involving recursion which respects membership or its transitive closure.

\subsubsection{The Inverse of a Relation}
The following function takes a relation and a function and returns a function which maps each element in the domain of the relation to the relation which holds between a predecessor of that element and its value under the function.
i.e. it maps the function over the predecessors of the element and returns the result as a relation.
It may therefore be used to rephrase primitive recursive definitions, and so the result which follows may be used to establish the existence of functions defined by primitive recursion.

\section{AXIOMS}

\subsection{Introduction}

Galactic set theory is a set theory with "galaxies" (previously known as "universes") axiomatised in Higher Order Logic.

\subsubsection{Scope}
This document is mainly concerned with the axioms of galactic set theory, but includes in addition some definitions and theorems which might easily have been part of the axiomatisation.
In the usual first order axiomatisations of set theory, for example, the {\it pair} constructor is introduced axiomatically.
In this axiomatisation neither the empty set nor {\it pair} are primitive, they are introduced by definition once the axioms have been presented.
Same goes for separation and intersection.
The theory "gst-ax" created by this document, consists of an axiomatic development of a well-founded set theory in ProofPower HOL, and is created as a child of "basic-hol".
This version of the theory is derived from a previous version in which "pseudo-urelements" were available, and in which the standard set theoretic vocabulary was used (which rendered the theory unusable in combination with the usual ProofPower HOL theory of sets).
Pseudo-urelements were dropped because I don't need them, and, however slight the complication they introduce, its not necessary.
To enable this theory to be used with the standard set theory (properties in set theoretic clothing) the volcabulary has been systematically subscripted with "g" (for galactic).

\subsubsection{Why Galactic?}

This document introduces Galactic Set Theory, which is similar to what has elsewhere been called Universal Set Theory (e.g. by Paul M. Cohn in his "Universal Algebra", but I dare say it came from somewhere else).
The "universes" in Cohn, and the galaxies here are mostly models of ZFC, except the smallest in which there is no infinite set.
The other main difference is that galactic set theory is formulated in higher order logic.

\subsection{Membership}

The first thing we do is to introduce a new ProofPower theory and, in that theory, the new TYPE SET together with the membership relation and a psuedo-urelement injection.

\subsubsection{The Type GS}

The sets under consideration will be the elements of a new type "GS" so the first thing we do is to introduce that new type.
GS is a {\it pure} {\it well-founded} set theory.
Since the theory will not be conservative, we make no attempt to relate the membership of "GS" to any of the types already available.

merge_pcs ["'savedthm_cs_¶_proof"] "'gst-ax";
set_merge_pcs ["basic_hol", "'gst-ax"];
new_type ("GS", 0);
=TEX

\subsubsection{Well Foundedness}

I will possibly be making use of two different treatments of well-foundedness (from the theories {\it U\_orders}, and {\it wf\_relp}) and it may be helpful to establish the connection between them.

The following theorem does the trick:

=GFT
UWellFounded_well_founded_thm =
   ô µ $<<· UWellFounded $<< ¤ well_founded $<<
=TEX

=SML
set_goal ([], ¬µ$<<· UWellFounded $<< ¤ well_founded $<<®);
a (rewrite_tac [get_spec ¬well_founded®, u_well_founded_induction_thm]);
val UWellFounded_well_founded_thm = save_pop_thm "UWellFounded_well_founded_thm";
=TEX

\subsubsection{Membership}

The most important constant is membership, which is a relation over the sets.
We can't define this constant (in this context) so it is introduced as a new constant (about which nothing is asserted except its name and type) and its properties are introduced axiomatically. 

=SML
new_const ("‰g", ”GS­GS­BOOL®);
declare_infix (230,"‰g");
=TEX

\subsection{Extensionality and Well-Foundedness}

The axioms of extensionality and well-foundedness may be thought of as telling us what kind of thing a set is (later axioms tell us how many of these sets are to be found in our domain of discourse).

\subsubsection{Extensionality}

The most fundamental property of membership (or is it of sets?) is {\it extensionality}, which tells us what kind of thing a set is.
The axiom tells us that if two sets have the same elements then they are in fact the same set.

It follows from the definitions of {\it IsPue} and {\it IsSet} and {\it ue\_inj\_axiom} that nothing is both a set and a urelement, and that urelements are equal iff the values from which they were obtained under Pue are equal.

It is convenient to have a function which gives the extension of a GS set as a SET of GSs.

\subsubsection{Well-Foundedness}

Wellfoundedness is asserted using the definition in the theory ``U\_orders'', which is conventional in asserting that each non-empty set has a minimal element.

The resulting induction principle (sometimes called Neotherian induction) is useful.

\subsection{The Ontology Axiom}

The remaining axioms are intended to ensure that the subset is a large and well-rounded subset of the cumulative heirarchy.
This is to be accomplished by defining a Galaxy as a set satisfying certain closure properties and then asserting that every set is a member of some Galaxy.
It is convenient to introduce new constants and axioms for each of the Galactic closure properties before asserting the existence of the Galaxies.

Here we define the subset relation and assert the existence of powersets and unions.

\subsubsection{The Ontology Axiom}

We now specify with a single axiom the closure requirements which ensure that our universe is adequately populated.
The ontology axiom states that every set is a member of some galaxy which is transitive and closed under formation of powersets and unions and under replacement.

\subsection{Separation}

Separation is introduced by conservative extension.

\subsubsection{Consistency Proof}

The specification which follows is introduced after proving that it is satisfied by a term involving the use of the Image function and the empty set.
(This is no longer ideal, a "nicer" proof that separation is conservative is now obtainable from the primitive replacement axiom.)
The basic idea is that a non-empty subset of any set, consisting of just those elements which satisfy a give property, can be shown to exist using {\it Imagep}.
The required subset is obtained using a function which is the identity function on elements of the original which satisfy the property, and which maps the rest to an element selected from those that do by the choice function.
A special case is made of the empty subset, which cannot be constructed from a non-empty set using "Imagep".
Thus, separation is definable in terms of Imagep but the definition depends on the existence of the empty set and the axiom of choice.
Using the more primitive replacement axiom the existence of the empty set 
The proof script is omitted (but is available in the source code to this page and is invoked as the theory is loaded).

If I had formulated replacement in the more traditional manner, using a many-one relation rather than a (HOL) function, neither the axiom of choice not the empty set axiom would not have been necessary.
It didn't occur to me at the time that there was a material difference!
One day I will rework this with the relational replacement axiom, since the functional one would be definable.

The consistency claim and the first step in the proof script showing the witness used to prove the claim are:

a (prove_tac[]);
save_cs_¶_thm (pop_thm());
=TEX
}%ignore

\subsubsection{Definition}

This higher order formulation of separation is accomplished by defining a new constant which takes a property of sets {\it p} and a set {\it s} and returns the subset of {\it s} consisting of those elements which satisfy {\it p}.
The definition uses the replacement principle, but since the image of a non-empty set cannot be empty a special case must be made where the result is the empty set.
The HOL choice function is also used, making this defined version of separation dependent on the axiom of choice as well as replacement.

\subsection{Functional Replacement}

The more convenient form of replacement which takes a function rather than a relation (and hence needs no "ManyOne" caveat) is introduced here.

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Though a functional formulation of replacement is most convenient for most applications, it has a number of small disadvantages which have persuaded me to stay closer to the traditional formulation of replacement in terms of relations.
The more convenient functional version will then be introduced by definition (so if you don't know what I'm talking about, look forward to compare the two versions).

For the record the disadvantages of the functional one (if used as an axiom) are:
<ol>
<li>It can't be used to prove the existence of the empty set.</li>
<li>When used to define separation it requires the axiom of choice.</li>
</ol>

\subsubsection{Imagep}
Now we prove a more convenient version of replacement which takes a HOL function rather than a relation as its argument.
It states that the image of any set under a function is also a set.

a (¶_tac ¬RelIm fr s'®);
a (¤_FC_T asm_rewrite_tac (get_spec ¬RelIm®));
save_cs_¶_thm (pop_thm ());

"Imagep f s" is the image of s through f.

We now show that galaxies are closed under Image.

}%ignore

Pairs can be defined as the image of some two element set under a function defined by a conditional.
A suitable two element set can be constructed from the empty set using the powerset construction a couple of times.
However, having proven that this can be done (details omitted), we can introduce the pair constructor by conservative extension as follows.
(the ProofPower tool shows that it has accepted my proof by putting this extension into the "definitions" section of the theory listing).

\subsection{Proof Context}

To simplify subsequent proofs a new "proof context" is created enabling automatic use of the results now available.

\subsubsection{Principles}

The only principle I know of which assists with elementary proofs in set theory is the principle that set theoretic conjectures can be reduced to the predicate calculus by using extensional rules for relations and for operators.

Too hasty a reduction can be overkill and may convert a simple conjecture into an unintelligible morass.
We have sometimes in the past used made available two proof contexts, an aggressive extensional one, and a milder non-extensional one.
However, the extensional rules for the operators are fairly harmless, expansion is triggered by the extensional rules for the relations (equality and subset), so a proof context containing the former together with a suitable theorem for the latter gives good control.

\subsubsection{Theorems Used Recklessly}
This is pretty much guesswork, only time will tell whether this is the best collection.
=SML
val gst_ax_thms = [
	š‰g_spec,
	get_spec ¬ð‰g®,
	get_spec ¬Þ‰g®,
	Imagep_spec,
	Pair_eq_thm,
	get_spec ¬Pair®,
	Sing_eq_thm,
	Sing_thm,
	Pair_Sing_eq_thm,
	Sing_Pair_eq_thm,
	Sep_thm,
	À‰g_thm,
	¡‰g_thm
];
val gst_opext_clauses =
	(all_µ_intro
	o list_±_intro
	o (map all_µ_elim))
	gst_ax_thms;
save_thm ("gst_opext_clauses", gst_opext_clauses);
=TEX

\subsubsection{Theorems Used Cautiously}
The following theorems are too aggressive for general use in the proof context but are needed when attempting automatic proof.
When an extensional proof is appropriate it can be initiated by a cautious (i.e. a "once") rewrite using the following clauses, after which the extensional rules in the proof context will be triggered.
=SML
val gst_relext_clauses =
	(all_µ_intro
	o list_±_intro
	o (map all_µ_elim))
	[gs_ext_axiom,
	get_spec¬$€‰g®];
save_thm ("gst_relext_clauses", gst_relext_clauses);
=TEX
There are a number of important theorems, such as well-foundedness and galaxy closure which have not been mentioned in this context.
The character of these theorems makes them unsuitable for the proof context, their application requires thought.

\subsubsection{Automatic Proof}
The basic proof automation is augmented by adding a preliminary rewrite with the relational extensionality clauses.
=SML
fun gst_ax_prove_conv thl =
	TRY_C (pure_rewrite_conv [gst_relext_clauses])
	THEN_C (basic_prove_conv thl);
=TEX

\subsubsection{Proof Context 'gst-ax}

=SML
add_rw_thms gst_ax_thms "'gst-ax";
add_sc_thms gst_ax_thms "'gst-ax";
add_st_thms gst_ax_thms "'gst-ax";
set_pr_conv gst_ax_prove_conv "'gst-ax";
set_pr_tac
	(conv_tac o gst_ax_prove_conv)
	"'gst-ax";
commit_pc "'gst-ax";
=TEX

Using the proof context "'gst-ax" elementary results in gst are now provable automatically on demand.
For this reason it is not necessary to prove in advance of needing them results such as the associativity of intersection, since they can be proven when required by an expression of the form "prove rule[] term" which proves {\it term} and returns it as a theorem.
If the required proof context for doing this is not in place the form ``
=INLINEFT
merge_pcs_rule ["basic_hol", 'gst-ax"] (prove_rule []) term
=TEX
'' may be used.
Since this is a little cumbersome we define the function {\it $gst\_ax\_rule$} and illustrate its use as follows:

=SML
val gst_ax_rule =
	(merge_pcs_rule1
	["basic_hol", "'gst-ax"]
	prove_rule) [];
val gst_ax_conv = 
	MERGE_PCS_C1
	["basic_hol", "'gst-ax"]
	prove_conv;
val gst_ax_tac =
	conv_tac o gst_ax_conv;
=TEX

\subsubsection{Examples}
The following are examples of the elementary results which are now proven automatically:
=SML
gst_ax_rule ¬
	a ¡‰g (b ¡‰g c)
	= (a ¡‰g b) ¡‰g c®;
gst_ax_rule ¬a ¡‰g b €‰g b®;

\section{FUNCTIONS}

A new "gst-fun" theory is created as a child of "gst-ax".
The theory will contain the definitions of ordered pairs, relations and functions and related material for general use.

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Most of the specification work which I am likely to do with galactic set theory will make use of functions.
My first application of the functions will be in the theory of pure functors, which is frivolous and unlikely to be widely applied, and so I am creating this theory first so that more generally applicable results which are required for the theory of pure functors will be available separately.
I have no clear idea of what this theory will contain, it will initially contain basic materials about functions, but will be augmented by anything else that turns out to be necessary elsewhere and which can appropriately be placed here.

\subsubsection{The Theory gst-fun}

The new theory is first created, together with a proof context which we will build up as we develop the theory.

=SML
open_theory "gst-ax";
force_new_theory "gst-fun";

\subsection{Ordered Pairs}

save_cs_¶_thm(pop_thm ());
=TEX
}%ignore

This is more abstract than the usual definition since it partly conceals the way in which ordered pairs are encoded.
We can't hide everything about the representation, because we will need to know at least that galaxies are closed under formation of ordered pairs, and that the elements are in the transitive closure of the ordered pair.
Behind the scenes the usual definition is used to prove that this looser definition is a conservative extension.

It would I believe now have been better just to use the explicit definition.

\subsection{Relations}

A relation is defined as a set of ordered pairs.
Cartesian product and relation space are defined.

\subsubsection{Cartesian Product}

The following theorem is required to introduce the conservative specification of cartesian product.
The witness for the proof is shown, involving a double application of replacement.
This is necessary because the loose specification of ordered pair does not provide sufficient information for a more conventional definition using separation.

\subsubsection{Function Space Non-Empty}

First, for the special case of function spaces with empty domain we prove the theorem that the empty set is a member:

=SML
set_goal([],¬µs t· š‰g ‰g š‰g ­‰g t®);
a (prove_tac[get_spec ¬$­‰g®,

Then that whenever the codomain is non-empty the function space is non-empty.

\subsection{Functional Abstraction}

Functional abstraction is defined as a new variable binding construct yeilding a functional set.

\subsubsection{Abstraction}

Because of the closeness to lambda abstraction $Ì‰g$ is used as the name of a new binder for set theoretic functional abstraction.

=SML
declare_binder "Ì‰g";
=TEX

To define a functional set we need a HOL function over sets together with a set which is to be the domain of the function.
Specification of the range is not needed.
The binding therefore yields a function which maps sets to sets (maps the domain to the function).

The following definition is a placeholder, a more abstract definition might eventually be substituted.
The function is defined as that subset of the cartesian product of the set s and its image under the function f which coincides with the graph of f over s.

¹HOLCONST
$Ì‰g: (GS ­ GS) ­
	GS  ­ GS
÷
µf s· $Ì‰g f s =
	Sep (s ¸‰g (Imagep f s))
	(Ìp· snd p = f (fst p))
°

\subsection{Application and Extensionality}

In this section we define function application and show that functions are extensional.

\subsubsection{Application}

Application by juxtaposition cannot be overloaded and is used for application of HOL functions.
Application of functional sets is therefore defined as an infix operator whose name is the empty name subscripted by "g".

=SML
declare_infix (250,"‰g");
=TEX

The particular form shown here is innovative in the value specified for applications of functions to values outside their domain.
The merit of the particular value chosen is that it makes true an extensionality theorem which quantifies over all sets as arguments to the function, which might not otherwise be the case.
Whether this form is useful I don't know.
Generally a result with fewer conditionals is harder to prove but easier to use, but in this case I'm not so sure of the benefit.

It may be noted that it may also be used to apply a non-functional relation, if what you want it some arbitrary value (selected by the choice function) to which some object relates.

\subsubsection{Partial functions are total}

Every partial function is total over its domain.
(there is an ambiguity in the use of the term "domain" for a partial function.
It might mean the left hand operand of some partial function space construction within which the partial function concerned may be found, or it might mean the set of values over which the function is defined.
Here we are saying that if f is a partial function over A, then its domain is some subset of A and f is a total function over that subset of A.)

\subsection{Override}

Override is an operator over sets which is intended primarily for use with functions.
It may be used to change the value of the function over any part of its domain by overriding it with a function which is defined only for those values.

\section{ORDINALS}

A new "gst-ord" theory is created as a child of "gst-ax".
The theory will contain the definitions of ordinals and related material for general use, roughly following "Set Theory" by Frank Drake, chapter 2 section 2.
The subsections in this document correspondend to the subsections in the book.

\subsubsection{Motivation}

This is really motivated purely by interest and self-education.
Since its so fundamental I think it likely to turn out handy.
Some of the material required is not specific to set theory and is quite widely applicable (in which case I actually develop it elsewhere and then just use it here.
Well-foundedness and induction over well-founded relations is the obvious case relevant to this part of Drake.
The recursion theorem is the important more general result which appears in the next section in Drake.
"more general" means "can be developed as a polymorphic theory in HOL and applied outside the context of set theory".
In fact these things have to be developed in the more general context to be used in the ways they are required in the development of set theory, since, for example, one wants to do definitions by recursion over the set membership relation where neither the function defined nor the relevant well-founded relation are actually sets.

\subsubsection{Divergence}

I have not followed Drake slavishly.
More or less, I follow him where it works out OK and looks reasonable and doesn't trigger any of my prejudices.

Sometimes the context in which I am doing the work makes some divergence desirable or necessary.
For example, I am doing the work in the context of a slightly eccentric set theory ("Galactic Set Theory") which mainly makes no difference, but has a non-standard formulation of the axiom of foundation.
Mainly this is covered by deriving the standard formulation and its consequences and using them where this is used by Drake (in proving the trichotomy theorem).
However, the machinery for dealing with well-foundedness makes a difference to how induction principles are best formulated and derived.

Sometimes I look at what he has done and I think, "no way am I going to do that".
Not necessarily big things, for example, I couldn't use his definition of successor ordinal which he pretty much admits himself is what we nerds call a kludge.

\subsubsection{The Theory ord}

The new theory is first created, together with a proof context which we will build up as we develop the theory.

\subsection{Definitions 2.1 and 2.3}

An ordinal is defined as a transitive and connected set.
The usual ordering over the ordinals is defined and also the successor function.

\subsubsection{The Definition}

The concept of transitive set has already been defined in theory {\it gst-ax}.
The concepts {\it connected} and {\it ordinal} are now defined.

\subsection{Theorem 2.2}

We prove that the empty set is an ordinal, and that the members of an ordinal and the successor of an ordinal are ordinals.

\subsubsection{The Empty Set is an Ordinal}

First we prove that the empty set is an ordinal, which requires only rewriting with the relevant definitions.

=SML
set_goal([],¬	ordinal š‰g	®);
a (rewrite_tac[get_spec ¬ordinal®, get_spec ¬transitive®, get_spec ¬connected®]);
val ordinal_š‰g = save_pop_thm "ordinal_š‰g";
=TEX

\subsubsection{The Successor of an Ordinal is an Ordinal}

Next we prove that the successor of an ordinal is an ordinal.
This is done in two parts, transitivity and connectedness.

=SML
set_goal([], ¬	µ x:GS· transitive x ´ transitive (suc‰o x)	®);
=TEX

\ignore{
=SML
a (rewrite_tac[get_spec ¬transitive®, get_spec ¬suc‰o®]
	THEN REPEAT strip_tac
	THEN once_rewrite_tac [gst_relext_clauses]
	THEN asm_rewrite_tac[]
	THEN REPEAT strip_tac);
a (spec_nth_asm_tac 4 ¬e®);
a (POP_ASM_T ante_tac);
a (once_rewrite_tac [get_spec¬$€‰g®]
	THEN strip_tac);
a (all_asm_fc_tac[]);
val trans_suc_trans = save_pop_thm "trans_suc_trans";
=TEX
}%ignore

=SML
set_goal([],¬µ x:GS·

\ignore{

	THEN all_asm_fc_tac[]
	THEN all_var_elim_asm_tac);
val conn_suc_conn = save_pop_thm "conn_suc_conn";
=TEX
}%ignore

These together enable us to prove:

=SML
set_goal([], ¬µ x:GS· ordinal x ´ ordinal (suc‰o x)®);
=TEX

The proof expands using the definition of ordinal, strips the goal and reasons forward from the resulting assumptions using the two lemmas proved above.

\subsubsection{The members of an Ordinal are Ordinals}

We now aim to prove that the members of an ordinal are ordinals.
We do this by proving first that they are connected and then that they are transitive.
First however, we show that any subset of a connected set is connected.
=SML
set_goal([],¬
	µ x:GS· connected x ´ µ y:GS· y €‰g x ´ connected y
®);
=TEX
The proof consists of expanding appropriate definitions, stripping the goal and then reasoning forward from the assumptions.
=SML
a (rewrite_tac (map get_spec [¬connected®, ¬$€‰g®])
	THEN REPEAT_N 7 strip_tac);
=GFT

=SML
a (all_asm_fc_tac[]);
a (REPEAT_N 2 (asm_fc_tac[]) THEN REPEAT strip_tac);
val conn_sub_conn = save_pop_thm "conn_sub_conn";
=TEX
Now we show that any member of an ordinal is an ordinal.
=SML
set_goal([],¬
	µ x:GS· ordinal x ´ µ y:GS· y ‰g x ´ connected y
®);
=TEX
Expanding the definition of ordinal and making use of transitivity enables us to infer that members of an ordinals are subsets and permits application of the previous result to obtain connectedness.
=SML
a (rewrite_tac (map get_spec [¬ordinal®, ¬transitive®])
	THEN REPEAT strip_tac);
a (all_asm_fc_tac []);
a (all_asm_fc_tac [conn_sub_conn]);
val conn_mem_ord = save_pop_thm "conn_mem_ord";
=TEX
To prove that the members of an ordinal are transitive, well-foundedness is needed.
Now we are ready to prove that the members of an ordinal are transitive.

set_goal([], ¬µ x:GS· ordinal x ´ µ y:GS· y ‰g x ´ transitive y®);

\subsection{Definition 2.6}

Successor and limit ordinals are defined.
Natural numbers are defined.

\subsubsection{}

These definitions are not the ones used by Drake, and not only the names but the concepts differ.
My successor predicate does not hold of the empty set.
I use the name "natural number" where he talks of integers, and generally I'm chosing longer names.

\subsection{Rank}

We define the rank of a set.

Before introducing the definition of rank we undertake the proof necessary to establish that the definition is conservative.
The key lemma in this proof is the proof that the relevant functional "respects" the membership relation.

\subsection{Proof Context}

In this section we define a proof context for ordinals.

\subsubsection{Proof Context}

=SML
add_pc_thms "'gst-ord" ([]);
set_merge_pcs ["basic_hol", "'gst-ax", "'gst-ord"];
commit_pc "'gst-ord";
=TEX

\section{NATURAL NUMBERS}

=SML
open_theory "gst-ord";
force_new_theory "gst-nat";
force_new_pc "'gst-nat";
merge_pcs ["'savedthm_cs_¶_proof"] "'gst-nat";
set_merge_pcs ["basic_hol", "'gst-ax", "'gst-ord", "'gst-nat"];
=TEX

¹HOLCONST
 natural_number : GS ­ BOOL
÷
  µs :GS· natural_number s ¤ s = š‰g ² (successor s ± µt· t‰g s ´ t = š‰g ² successor t)
°

\subsubsection{Ordering the Natural Numbers}

To get an induction principle for the natural numbers we first define a well-founded ordering over them.
Since I don't plan to use this a lot I use the name $<‰g‰n$ (less than over the natural numbers defined in galactic set theory).

=SML
declare_infix(240,"<‰g‰n");
=TEX

¹HOLCONST
 $<‰g‰n : GS ­ GS ­ BOOL
÷
  µx y:GS· x <‰g‰n y ¤ natural_number x ± natural_number y ± x ‰g y
°

Now we try to find a better proof that the one above that this is well-founded.
And fail, this is just a more compact rendition of the same proof.

=SML
set_goal([],¬well_founded $<‰g‰n®);
a (asm_tac gs_wf_thm1);
a (fc_tac [wf_restrict_wf_thm]);
a (SPEC_NTH_ASM_T 1 ¬Ìx y· natural_number x ± natural_number y® ante_tac
	THEN rewrite_tac[]);
a (lemma_tac ¬$<‰g‰n = (Ì x y· (natural_number x ± natural_number y) ± x ‰g y)®
	THEN1 (REPEAT_N 2 (once_rewrite_tac [ext_thm])
		THEN prove_tac[get_spec ¬$<‰g‰n®]));
a (asm_rewrite_tac[]);
val wf_nat_thm = save_pop_thm "wf_nat_thm";
=TEX
This allows us to do well-founded induction over the natural number which the way I have implemented it is "course-of-values" induction.
However, for the sake of form I will prove that induction principle as an explicit theorem.
This is just what you get by expanding the definition of well-foundedness in the above theorem.
=SML
val nat_induct_thm = save_thm ("nat_induct_thm",
	(rewrite_rule [get_spec ¬well_founded®] wf_nat_thm));
=TEX
Note that this theorem can only be used to prove properties which are true of all sets, so you have to make it conditional 
=INLINEFT
(natural_number n ´ whatever)
=TEX
I suppose I'd better do another one.
=SML
set_goal([], ¬µ p· (µ x· natural_number x ± (µ y· y <‰g‰n x ´ p y) ´ p x)
	´ (µ x· natural_number x ´ p x)®);
a (asm_tac (rewrite_rule []
	(all_µ_intro (µ_elim ¬Ìx· natural_number x ´ p x® nat_induct_thm))));
a (rewrite_tac [all_µ_intro (taut_rule ¬a ± b ´ c ¤ b ´ a ´ c®)]);
a (lemma_tac ¬µ p x· (µ y· y <‰g‰n x ´ p y)
	¤ (µ y· y <‰g‰n x ´ natural_number y ´ p y)®);
(* *** Goal "1" *** *)
a (rewrite_tac [get_spec ¬$<‰g‰n®]);
a (REPEAT strip_tac THEN all_asm_fc_tac[]);
(* *** Goal "2" *** *)
a (asm_rewrite_tac[]);
val nat_induct_thm2 = save_pop_thm "nat_induct_thm2";
=TEX
I've tried using that principle and it too has disadvantages.
Because $<‰g‰n$ is used the induction hypothesis is more awkward to use (weaker) than it would have been if $‰g$ had been used.
Unfortunately the proof of an induction theorem using plain set membership is not entirely trivial, so its proof has to be left til later.
=SML

We will need to know that these are all distinct ordinals.
