\section{Introduction}

For context and motivation see \cite{rbjt000}.

Several structures are provided, each section below provides a signature and a structure matching the signature (though the code is not listed).

val Ûsplit_pair_rewrite_tacÝ : TERM list -> THM list -> TACTIC;
val Ûmap_uncurry_convÝ : CONV;
val Ûmap_uncurry_ruleÝ : THM -> THM;
=DESCRIBE
These facilities are to permit rewriting with the definition of or theorems about functions which take pairs as arguments, and are defined using paired abstraction or pattern matching on pairs.

$split\_pair\_conv$ $¬tm®$ yields the theorem $ô tm = (Fst tm, Snd tm)$.

$split\_pair\_rewrite\_tac$, when supplied with a list of terms which have the type of ordered pairs, will expand each occurence of a term in the list to an explicit ordered pair using  $split\_pair\_conv$,
and will then apply $pure\_rewrite\_tac$ to the theorems.

$map\_uncurry\_conv$ takes a term and eliminates all occurences of $Uncurry$ in it by rewriting with the definition and beta reducing the result, and then eliminates all resulting terms of the form $(Fst tm, Snd tm)$ in favour of $tm$.

$map\_uncurry\_rule$ applies $map\_uncurry\_conv$ to the conclusion of a theorem.
The effect is to make a definition or theorem using pair patterns work for rewriting in cases where the argument is not supplied as an explicit pair, {\it provided that a paired abstraction was used in a universal quantification enclosing the equation}.
So if you want to formulate definitions and generalise them with this rule, use paired abstractions in the quantifiers.

=GFT Example
(concl o map_uncurry_rule) (asm_rule ¬µx y (v, w)· A (x,y) (v,w) = x=v ± y=w®);

\section{Stripping With Failure}

=DOC
signature ÛStripFailÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This signature provides facilities for stripping assumptions which fail if the current goal remains unchanged.
This is so that tactics which generate new assumptions, e.g. $fc\_tac$ can be repeated until no new assumptions are generated.
=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûcheck_asm_tac1Ý : THM -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
$check\_asm\_tac1$ is a similar to $check\_asm\_tac$ but will fail rather than leave the goal unchanged.

$check\_asm\_tac1\,thm$ checks the form of the theorem, $thm$,
and then takes the first applicable action from the following table:

{\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{4in}|}\hline
$thm$ & action \\ \hline
$‡ ô t$ & proves goal if its conclusion is $t$ \\ \hline
$‡ ô T$ & as $fail\_tac$ \\ \hline
$‡ ô F$ & proves goal\\ \hline
$‡ ô ³t$ & proves goal if $t$ in assumptions, fails if $³t$ is in assumptions, else as $asm\_tac$\\ \hline
$‡ ô t$ & proves goal if $³t$ in assumptions, fails if $t$ is in assumptions, else as $asm\_tac$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}}

During the search through the assumptions in the last two cases,
$check\_asm\_tac1$ also checks to see whether any of the assumptions is
equal to the conclusion of the goal, and if so proves the goal.
It also checks to see if the conclusion of the theorem
is already an assumption, in which case the tactic fails.
When all the assumptions have been examined, if none of the
above actions is applicable, the conclusion of the theorem is
added to the assumption list.

=ENDDOC

=DOC
val Ûstrip_asm_tac1Ý : THM -> TACTIC;
=DESCRIBE
$strip\_asm\_tac1$ is a tactic for stripping down or otherwise transforming a theorem before adding it into the assumptions.

The transformations it undertakes are determined primarily by the current proof context which contains a conversion for stripping assumptions, but there are in addition a small number of effects which cannot be achieved by a conversion and are built into this tactic.

First the current stripping conversion will be applied repeatedly until it no longer applies.

Then the following simplification techniques will be tried.
Using $sat$ as an abbreviation for $strip\_asm\_tac$:
=GFT
sat (ô a ± b) 			­	sat (ô a) THEN sat (ô b)
sat (¶x·a)			­	sat (a[x'/x] ô a[x'/x])
sat (ô a ² b)({‡} t)		­	sat (a ô a) ({‡} t) ; sat (b ô b) ({‡} t)
=TEX

The effect is to break conjunctions into two separate theorems, to do a case split on disjunctions and to skolemise existentials.

After all of the available transformation techniques have been exhausted $strip\_asm\_tac$ then passes the theorems to $check\_asm\_tac1$ (q.v.) to discharge the goal or to generate additional assumptions.

\section{Theories, Proof Contexts and Consistency}

=DOC
signature ÛPreConsisProofÝ = sig
=DESCRIBE
This signature provide the wherewithal to conduct a consistency proof for a HOL constant specification before introducing the specification, so that the specification can be seen to be consistent and will appear in the theory listing as if no consistency proof had been necessary.

The signature also provides some procedures to incorporate exception handling require when a document is required to create or to recreate a theory, and must therefore first delete things which are not necessarily present, similarly for proof contexts and other functions for manipulating proof contexts.

\subsection{Doing Consistency Proofs before Axiomatic Descriptions}

=DOC
val Ûsave_cs_¶_thmÝ : THM -> unit;
=DESCRIBE
This function may be used to provide to the system a theorem which establishes the consistency of a HOL constant specification about to be introduced.

To avoid getting theory listings in which the definitions of some constants are given using $ConstSpec$ I like to do any necessary consistency proofs before introducing the constant specification which needs them.
For this to do any good, the automatic consistency prover has to know that I done it.

If used in conjunction with the partial proof context $'savedthm_cs_¶_conv$ the theorem will be used to establish the consistency of the specification avoid the need to place a consistency caveat on the stored form of the specification in the theory.

=ENDDOC

=DOC
(* Proof Context: Û'savedthm_cs_¶_proofÝ *)

\subsection{Partial Primitive Recursive Definitions}


=DOC
val Ûevaluate_¶_cd_thm2Ý : THM ->
	(TERM list * int list * TYPE * (TERM list)list * THM);
=DESCRIBE
This is an adaptation of $evaluate\_¶\_cd\_thm$ to allow for functions defined over a part of a type by primitive recursion, i.e. for a partial function defined as a loose definition of a total function.
For this purpose the uniqueness property is not to be expected, though a weak analogue might be obtained.
The following documentation comes from the original, modified as necessary.

This gives the sophisticated user direct access to the standard internal mechanism
set by $pp'set\_eval\_ad\_¶\_cd\_thm$.
Its input theorem is of the ``standard'' form of a primitive recursion theorem or pattern matching theorem, except that the existential is not unique:
=GFT
µ fn1 fn2 ...· ¶f·
(µ a11 ...· f (dc1[a11,...]) = fn1 (patt11[f,a11...]) (patt12[f,a11,...]) ...) ±
(µ a21 ...· f (dc2[a21,...]) = fn1 (patt21[f,a21...]) (patt22[f,a21,...]) ...) ±
...
=TEX
Compare this with:
=GFT
prim_rec_thm = ô µ z s· ¶‰1 f· (f 0 = z) ± (µ n· f (n + 1) = s (f n) n)  
=TEX
The uniqueness of the function $f$ is not required for consistency proofs, and in some cases may not be provable, so this variant is for use where the recursion theorem merely asserts existence rather than unique existence.

The $fn_i$ (in the example: $z$ and $s$) are the new functions which express the behaviour
of each data constructor.
$f$ ($f$) is the function defined by clausal definitions.
The $a_{ij}$ ($n$ in the second conjunct) are the free variables of the data construction.
The $dc_i$ ($n+1$ and $0$) are data constructions, as in the example given these do not need to be the original data constructors of a type, just applications of constants and variables.
The $patt_{ij}$ ($f\ n$, $n$) are the arguments to the new functions. 
They may involve uses of the clausally defined function.

The result of this function is:
the list of data constructions,
a list of free variable counts in each data construction,
the type of $f$,
a list of free variables in each data construction,
and a theorem of the form:
=GFT
ô µ pred1 ...·

=TEX
This is in a convenient form for proving the existence of
clausally defined functions, in particular
recursive functions within $basic\_prove\_¶\_conv$.
The $pred_i$, $x_{ij}$ and $y_i$ are generated by $gen\_vars$.
$pp'TS$ is an identity function, with defining theorem
in theory ``misc'' of key ``pp'ts$\_$def''.

This function uses the same error codes as the original, so error message 58007 will have the wrong text and should be understood as below.

\subsection{Partial Primitive Recursive Definitions}

For each item of clausal definition material we hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The list of data constructor recognisers.
These are the generic terms which must be matchable to the actual argument.
\item
The number of free variables there should be in the use of the constructor (e.g. 2 for $Cons$, 0 for $Nil$).
\item
An instance of the most general type of the function's argument.
\item
A list of dummy arguments for each ``constructor'', to allow dummy
conjuncts to be created.
\item
The actual theorem.
The theorem is an equation, whose LHS is of the form:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Universally quantify by one predicate per ``constructor'',
\item
Existentially quantify by function, $f$,
\item
one conjunct per constructor, in same order as predicates.
\item
Each conjunct will universally quantified in the order that
the the free variables of the subterm to which $f$ is first applied, that is a recognised argument by the data constructor
recogniser.
\item
The body of the conjunct will be the associated predicate
applied to each available use of $f$ and its arguments,
the first being the recognised argument.
\end{itemize}

=DESCRIBE
These are tactics which use theorems whose conclusions are
implications, or from which implications can be derived using
the canonicalisation function
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
, q.v., to reason forwards from the assumptions of a goal.

The basic step is to take a theorem of the form
=INLINEFT
‡ ô t1 ´ t2
=TEX
\ and an assumption of the form
=INLINEFT
t1'
=TEX
\ where $t1'$ is unifiable with $t1$ and to deduce the
corresponding instance of $t2'$. The new theorem,
=INLINEFT
„ ô t2'
=TEX
\ say, may then be stripped into the assumptions.

In the case of
=INLINEFT
ufc_tac
=TEX
\ the implicative theorem is always derived from the list
of theorems given as an argument.
In the case of
=INLINEFT
asm_ufc_tac
=TEX
\ the assumptions are also used.
In all of the tactics the rule 
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
\ is used to derive an implicative canonical form from the
candidate implicative theorems.
Normally combination of an implicative theorem and an assumption
is then tried in turn and all resulting theorems are stripped into
the assumptions of the goal.
However, if the chaining results contain a theorem whose conclusion is ¬F® then the first such found will be stripped
into the assumptions, and all other theorems discarded.

If one of the implications has the form
=INLINEFT
t1 ´ t2 ´ t3
=TEX
\ or
=INLINEFT
t1 ± t2 ´ t3
=TEX
\ and if assumptions matching $t1$ and $t2$ are available,
=INLINEFT
ufc_tac
=TEX
\ or
=INLINEFT
asm_ufc_tac
=TEX
\ will derive an intermediate implication
=INLINEFT
t2 ´ t3
=TEX
\ and
=INLINEFT
asm_ufc_tac
=TEX
\ could then be used to derive $t3$.
The variants with $all\_$ may be used to derive $t3$ directly without
generating any intermediate implications in the assumptions.
They work like the corresponding tactic without $all\_$ but any theorems
which are derived which are themselves implications are not stripped into
the assumptions but instead are used recursively to derive further theorems.
When no new implications are derivable all of the non-implicative theorems
derived during the process are stripped into the assumptions.

Note that the use of
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
\ implies that conversions from the
proof context are applied to generate implications.
E.g., in an appropriate proof-context covering set theory,
=INLINEFT
a € b
=TEX
\ might be treated as the implication
=INLINEFT
µx·x  a ´ x  b
=TEX
.
Also variables which appear free in a theorem are not considered as candidates
for instantiation
(in order to give some control over the number of results generated).
The tacticals,
=INLINEFT
UFC_T1
=TEX
\ and 
=INLINEFT
ASM_UFC_T1
=TEX
\ may be used to avoid the use of
=INLINEFT
fc_canon
=TEX
.

For example, the tactic:
=GFT
asm_ufc_tac[] THEN asm_ufc_tac[]
=TEX
will prove the goal:
=GFT
{p x, µx·p x ´ q x, µx·q x ´ r x} r x.
=TEX

The variants with $¤$ in the name use $fc_¤_canon$ instead of $fc_canon$ for processing the rules so that a concluding equivalence is not broken into implications and the results of forward chaining can be used for rewriting (however, this still won't work unless there are outer quantifiers to prevent the equivalence from being broken up when stripped into the assumptions).

All of these tactics add the results into the assumptions using $strip_asms_tac1$ and therefore fail if no new assumptions are added (unless the goal is discharged), except the ones whose name includes $rewrite$ which attempt the rewrite the conclusion of the goal with the results instead of stripping them into the assumptions.

In $unify\_´\_mp_rule$ the two theorems will be unified as necessary to permit inference by modus ponens.
Only variables universally quantified at the outer level will be candidates for instantiation, and in each of the premises only type variables which do not appear in the assumptions will be elegible for instantiation.
The two theorems are stripped of their outer universal quantifiers and the antecedent of the first (which must be an implication) will also be stripped of universal quantifiers and will then be unified with the second (without permitting substitution for the quanitifiers on the antecedent).
If this suceeds the consequent is inferred (after adding quantifiers as necessary to the second theorem and instantiating the quantifiers as necessary in the first theorem).
Then any variables which are free in the result but were previously bound are rebound.

$on\_conc$ and $on\_asms$ apply their arguments respectively to the conclusion or the list of assmuptions of the current goal.

$rew\_thms$, $rew\_specs$, $bc\_thms$ retrieve respectively theorems ($thms$) or specifications ($specs$) which can be used to sucessfully rewrite ($rew$) or backchain from ($bc$) the term supplied as an argument.

$fc\_thms$ and $all\_fc\_thms$, when supplied with a list of assumptions, retrieve theorems which will yield results using $fc\_tac$ and $all\_fc\_tac$.

$todo()$ returns a count of how many theorems or specifications are applicable to the current goal, classified according to the method of application.
$bc$ = back chaining, $fc$ = forward chaining, $rw$ = rewriting.
