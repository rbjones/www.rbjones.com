I will endeavour to follow the structure of Grice's paper \emph{Vacuous names}\cite{griceVN, quineWO}.
However, the method employed for the formal analysis, which is called ``shallow embedding'', is essentially semantic, and involves addressing semantic fundamentals before finding manageable systactic presentations, and we therefore find it necessary to address key aspects of the semantics before considering the details of syntactic derivation.

\subsection{Preliminary Formalities}

Just in case I need multiple incompatible accounts I have a ``top level'' theory under which all other gricean theories will be placed.

\section{The Problem}\label{G1}

Our starting point is a list of eight inclinations supplied by Grice and summarised here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item That individual constants be admitted.
\item Note that names are sometimes ``vacuous''
\item Thence that a constant might lack a designatum.
\item That excluded middle and bivalence neverthess remain unqualified.
\item That a claim about a non-designating constant be false and its negation true.
\item That no unusual constraints on ``U.I.'' \footnote{Universal Instantiation} and ``E.G.'' \footnote{Existential Generalisation} be introduced.
\item That the law of identity (in the form $µx· x=x$) be a theorem\footnote{Which seems to suggest that identity is not a predicate.}.
\item That derivability implies entailment.
\end{enumerate}

In relation to these Grice points out two difficulties as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Inclinations 2, 3 and 7 between them seem prima facie to enable proofs of the existence of non-existent entities (e.g. ``Pegasus exists'').

\item[(b)] Inclinations 5 and 6 would if gratified permit us to infer that there exists something which does not fly from the premise that Pegasus does not exist.

\end{itemize}

He then lists five approaches to resolving the difficulties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To resist inclination 3 and insists that constants have a designatum.
\item Resisting inclinations 4 and 5, insist that a predication to a non designating term and their negations lack a truth value. 
\item Resist inclination 1 and do without individual constants.
\item Resist inclination 2 by insisting that all constants have a desgnatum, which might perhaps ``be'' without existing.
\item Resist 6 by adding requirements on existential generalisation that the relevant constant be shown to designate.
\item Resist 8, allowing that the deductive system be not strictly sound, but only so subject to the constants used as in 6 designating.
\end{enumerate}

Grice does not discuss any of these alternatives, but instead proposes to attempt to square the circle by devising a system which satisfies all these (apparently) incompatible inclinations.

\section{System Q: Objectives}

Grice now proposes a first order predicate calculus meeting two particular objectives, spelt out in five points of further detail.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] That a sentence such as ``Pegasus does not fly'' be capable of rendition in two distinct ways one of which will be true and the other false in the case that Peagasus does not exist. 
These correpond to disambiguations of the logical structure of the sentence either as predicating non-flying or denying a predication as flying.
\item[(ii)] That in either case the inference from ``Pegasus does not fly'' to ``there is something which does not fly'' is to be admitted.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item U.I. and E.G. are acceptable without special side conditions.
\item Some sentences involving non-denoting constants will be true and provable.
\item It will be formally decidable whether a sentence depends for its truth on whether some constant designates.
\item It will be possible to find in Q representation of sentences such as ``Pegasus exists''.
\item There will be an extension of Q in which identity is represented.\footnote{No discussion here of whether identity is a predicate.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}

A new theory is needed which I will call ``ariscat'' which is created here:

=SML
open_theory "grice";
force_new_theory "ghp1";
=TEX

\ignore{
=SML
force_new_pc Û"'ghp1"Ý;
merge_pcs ["'savedthm_cs_¶_proof"] "'ghp1";
set_merge_pcs ["rbjmisc", "'ghp1"];
=TEX
}%ignore
