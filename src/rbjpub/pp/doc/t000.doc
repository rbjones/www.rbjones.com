\section{Introduction}

The documents described here form a collection bound primarily by the technologies which have been used to produce them, and consist of documents which include formal material in Higher Order Logic processed by {\Product} and which are prepared using \LaTeX and delivered in PDF. 
They are all incomplete, and show me in skeptical mode (i.e. seeking knowledge, with uncertain results).
Gradually however, these attempts have become more substantial, and ongoing work is now conceived of as falling in one substantial project in formal philosophy.

As well as an informal overview, this document contains abstracts from each document, document references, a complete set of theory listings and a consolidated index, so that for each formal name defined the document in which it is defined can readily be located.
There is a flaw in this at present, since you only discover the theory and its not obvious how to get from the theory name to the document reference.

For the record, some information about the various earlier materials is retained.

\subsection{Current Project}

My present `focus' is on work intended eventually to form a book entitled ``A Formal History of Philosophical Logic''.
This will appear here as a series of documents corresponding to the chapters of the intended book.
What these are is not settled, but the idea is to trace the history by constructing formal models of various historically important philosophical theories.

The ones I have at present in mind are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Plato and Aristotle \cite{rbjt028}
\item Leibniz
\item Hume and Kant
\item Frege
\item Russell and Wittgenstein's Tractatus \cite{rbjt030}
\item Carnap
\end{itemize}

However, what to do from Frege onwards is pretty much an open book.

There is a purpose which will gradually refine this conception of the coverage.
This formal book is to provide substance behind a plain prose articulation of a philosophy of ``metaphysical positivism'', it will exemplify methods articulated in that book \cite{rbjt029}, and will provide technical backing for some of the claims informally presented in that book.

\subsection{Earlier Work}

Some of the problems are themselves inherently unformalisable, and so the application of formal methods is expected to yield only incomplete models.
The underyling methodological thesis is that even problems which cannot be formally modelled may be illuminated by the study of formalisable near neighbours.
This is one way of looking at some of the work which takes place in set theory at present, though set theorists may not look at their work in that way.
No orginality is claimed for this approach to philosophy.

The philosophical objectives may further be described as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Something rather vague about semantics, one element of which is a certain kind of analysis of the concept of analyticity.
\item Concrete ontology.
\item Abstract ontology.
\item X-Logic.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Semantics}

On the concept of analyticity the study of which is represented here only by the empty shell of one document \cite{rbjt001}, I shall say no more at present.

The main thrust of my interest in semantics is in the foundations of abstract semantics.
For me this is the semantics of set theory, and my approach to this topic is through the study of membership structures \cite{rbjt004}, also scarcely begun.

\paragraph{Concrete Ontology}

Concrete ontology is concerned with what can be known about what concrete entities there are in the Universe.
My interest in this began when I attempted to produce an example of how to formalise a scientific theory, and I began to be interested in the metaphysical problems which arise in the course of attempting to formalise fundamental laws of physics.
My results of my failed attempts to formalize newtonian physics are to be found in \cite{rbjt002}.
I started this intent to minimise my involvement in the underlying mathematics, but was provoked into attempting a more serious approach to the mathematics by Rob Arthan, who started for me the work on differential geometry which can now be found in \cite{rbjt003}.

My present feeling is that this is an interesting area but one in which I may not be able to make enough progress to be worthwhile.
If time were no obstacle my inclination now would be to approach the problem via the theory of general relativity, in particular via formalisation of aspects of \cite{hawking73}, supported by a development of differential geometry following reasonably closely chapter 2 of that book.

\paragraph{Abstract Ontology}

The question what can be known about what abstract objects do or may exist is to be addressed primarily through the formal study of membership structures \cite{rbjt004}, and at present seems the domain most likely to receive my serious attention.
However, this area too is hardly begun, and scarcely progressing, because of various matters which seem to me to require attention before this work can have much hope of success.
Various other work on set theory is now present, some of it making some use of the material on membership structure (but not much).

There is some exploratory work on the formalisation of NF and NFU in HOL in \cite{rbjt019}.
This lead me to experiment with non-well-founded ontologies directly without using NF, for this purpose I moved "Galactic Set Theory" (which is well-founded) from the directory pp/gst where it was originally done in xml into \cite{rbjt021} and used it in the construction of a non-well-founded interpretation of set theory described in {\it PolySet Theory}\cite{rbjt020}.
However, after an initial foray the work on polysets was continued under Isabelle and hence in the directory isar, though there is also an informal account in {\it PolySets}\cite{rbjp011}.
This work was discontinued when I decided this ontology was to slim and adopted a more radical approach to non-well-founded set theory which may be found in the documents \cite{rbjt021,rbjt024,rbjt026,rbjt027}.
This now represent my most substantial line of research in the foundations of mathematics, but has been suspended pro-tem in favour of my project on the history of philosophical logic.

I also have a document on category theory \cite{rbjt017}  which may as well be mentioned here, though its motivation is not philosophical, except insofar as it connects (which at present it does not) with my lucubrations on categorical foundation systems.
There is now a properly foundational exercise in formal category theory in \cite{rbjt018}, based on the work on NFU in \cite{rbjt019}.

There is also a foray into Conrad's surreal ontology in ``Surreal Geometric Analysis'' \cite{rbjt022}.
This was started when for a short time I thought it might be worth using surreal numbers for the formalisation of the theory of relativity because I thought it might make the handling of singularities nicer.
Since I didn't get very far, the interest such as it is in the material present is that there is an attempt at an axiomatisation of the surreal numbers independently of set theory (the idea was to construct this in set theory, but the end result would be to make a set-free axiomatisation of surreals into a proper axiomatic foundation for mathematics (at least technically).

\paragraph{X-Logic}

This is represented at present by one document of formal models \cite{rbjt016}.

\subsection{Supporting Theories and Tools}

In all this formal work material progress depends upon developments in various enabling technologies not themselves of direct philosophical interest.
Like everything else in sight this work is all experimental and incomplete.
In these matters, if a problem can be avoided it should be, so one way of improving my treatment of a problem here is to find a way to approach the target applications which does not depend upon the proposed technology.
The most obvious candidate here is some of all of the material on inductive definitions.

The supporting theories and tools are, for concrete ontology:

\begin{enumerate}
\item differential geometry \cite{rbjt003}
[this material is obsolescent, being displaced by an approach based on geometric algebra, under development by Rob Arthan]
\end{enumerate}

And for abstract ontology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item inductive and co-inductive definitions \cite{rbjt007,rbjt008}
\item well-founded relations \cite{rbjt009}
\end{enumerate}

And more generally:
\begin{itemize}
\item Miscellaneous theory supplements and tactics \cite{rbjt006,rbjt010}
\item Inference by chaining and supporting materials \cite{rbjt010,rbjt011,rbjt012}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ProofPower}

The documents in this series all make use of \Product.
This determines the language in which formal content is expressed (which is {\Product-HOL}).

The there are three different (incomplete) documents about {\Product} \cite{rbjt013,rbjt014,rbjt015}, all produced in the course of co-authoring with Rob Arthan an article for the BCS-FACS newsletter.
