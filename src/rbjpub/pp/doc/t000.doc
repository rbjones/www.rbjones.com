\section{INTRODUCTION}

The documents described here are my current working documents.
It is the purpose of this document to describe briefly the nature of the enterprise and the place in that enterprise of the individual documents.

The somewhat distant overall aim is to approach certain problems in abstract semantics and in metaphysics by formal methods.
The problems are themselves inherently unformalisable, and so the application of formal methods is expected to yield only incomplete models.
The underyling methodological thesis is that even problems which cannot be formally modelled may be illuminated by the study of formalisable near neighbours.
This is one way of looking at some of the work which takes place in set theory at present, though set theorists may not look at their work in that way.
No orginality is claimed for this approach to philosophy.

The philosophical objectives may further be described as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Something rather vague about semantics, one element of which is a certain kind of analysis of the concept of analyticity.
\item Concrete ontology.
\item Abstract ontology.
\item X-Logic.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Semantics}

On the concept of analyticity the study of which is represented here only by the empty shell of one document \cite{rbjt001}, I shall say no more at present.

The main thrust of my interest in semantics is in the foundations of abstract semantics.
For me this is the semantics of set theory, and my approach to this topic is through the study of membership structures \cite{rbjt004}, also scarcely begun.

\subsection{Concrete Ontology}

Concrete ontology is concerned with what can be known about what concrete entities there are in the Universe.
My interest in this began when I attempted to produce an example of how to formalise a scientific theory, and I began to be interested in the metaphysical problems which arise in the course of attempting to formalise fundamental laws of physics.
My results of my failed attempts to formalize newtonian physics are to be found in \cite{rbjt002}.
I started this intent to minimise my involvement in the underlying mathematics, but was provoked into attempting a more serious approach to the mathematics by Rob Arthan, who started for me the work on differential geometry which can now be found in \cite{rbjt003}.

My present feeling is that this is an interesting area but one in which I may not be able to make enough progress to be worthwhile.
If time were no obstacle my inclination now would be to approach the problem via the theory of general relativity, in particular via formalisation of aspects of \cite{hawking73}, supported by a development of differential geometry following reasonably closely chapter 2 of that book.

\subsection{Abstract Ontology}

The question what can be known about what abstract objects do or may exist is to be addressed primarily through the formal study of membership structures \cite{rbjt004}, and at present seems the domain most likely to receive my serious attention.
However, this area too is hardly begun, and scarcely progressing, because of various matters which seem to me to require attention before this work can have much hope of success.

I also have a document on category theory \cite{rbjt017}  which may as well be mentioned here, though its motivation is not philosophical, except insofar as it connects (which at present it does not) with my lucubrations on categorical foundation systems.
There is now a properly foundational exercise in formal category theory in \cite{rbjt018}.

\subsection{X-Logic}

This is represented at present by one document of formal models \cite{rbjt016}.

\subsection{Supporting Theories and Tools}

In all this formal work material progress depends upon developments in various enabling technologies not themselves of direct philosophical interest.
Like everything else in sight this work is all experimental and incomplete.
In these matters, if a problem can be avoided it should be, so one way of improving my treatment of a problem here is to find a way to approach the target applications which does not depend upon the proposed technology.
The most obvious candidate here is some of all of the material on inductive definitions.

The supporting theories and tools are, for concrete ontology:

\begin{enumerate}
\item differential geometry \cite{rbjt003}
[this material is obsolescent, being displaced by an approach based on geometric algebra, under development by Rob Arthan]
\end{enumerate}

And for abstract ontology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item inductive and co-inductive definitions \cite{rbjt007,rbjt008}
\item well-founded relations \cite{rbjt009}
\end{enumerate}

And more generally:
\begin{itemize}
\item Miscellaneous theory supplements and tactics \cite{rbjt006,rbjt010}
\item Inference by chaining and supporting materials \cite{rbjt010,rbjt011,rbjt012}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ProofPower}

The documents in this series all make use of \Product.
This determines the language in which formal content is expressed (which is {\Product-HOL}).

The there are three different (incomplete) documents about {\Product} \cite{rbjt013,rbjt014,rbjt015}, all produced in the course of co-authoring with Rob Arthan an article for the BCS-FACS newsletter.

\section{ABSTRACTS}

In this section are presented the abstracts from the documents.
They are in inverse order of document creation, apart from the first entry which is that for this document.
