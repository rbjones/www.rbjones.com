This document consists of two parts.
The first is a theory of well-orderings prepared by Rob Arthan for possible inclusion in the ProofPower theory of ordered sets.
The second is material on well-foundedness, mainly consisting in the proof of the recursion theorem which is needed for consistency proofs of definitions by transfinite recursion respecting (if that's the right term) some well founded relationship.

\subsection{RBJ's Preface}

For context and motivation see \cite{rbjt000}.

This document has been produced by Roger Jones by hacking a document written by Rob Arthan called {\it ordered\_sets}.

This preface contains my notes on what I have done to it:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the name of the document.
\item Make sure theory listing uses aliases.
\item Change so that the theory of orders is not incorporated by duplication.
\item Change to suppress the listing of proofs and to include instead displays of key theorems and lemmas in the narrative.
\item Messed about with the section structure.
\item Put material on relations over a whole type and the independence proofs into a separate theory.
\item Added the material on transitive closure, the well-founded part of a relationship, and the recursion theorem.
\end{enumerate}

\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{INTRODUCTION}

This note contains various definitions and theorems, many of which are ultimately destined for
the {\Product} theory {\it orders}, which, it is intended, will supply a generally
useful collection of definitions and results relating to ordered sets of various kinds
(including ordered sets accompanied by some finer structure, e.g., an ordered set given as the
transitive closure of  a, not necessarily transitive, well-founded, relation, representing
some pattern for defining functions by recursion).

The significant mathematical facts that this note adds to the theory
of ordered sets are: Zorn's lemma for relations viewed as propositional
functions, the well-ordering principle and some useful equivalences to do with
well-foundedness (e.g., we show that a set is well-founded iff. it has no
infinite descending chains). These results and their proofs serve to validate
the definitions.

In part, the purpose of this note is to investigate relationships between various
primitive notions that are commonly used in talking about ordered sets.  In particular,
it is common in the literature for concepts such as well-foundedness or antisymmetry
to be defined so that they entail other properties such as irreflexivity. The goal here
is to fill out the list of primitive notions offered in the theory {\it orders} to give an
adequate vocabulary to state the various definitions commonly given in the literature
in terms of primitive notions that are independent. The result is a list of six primitive notions:
reflexivity, irreflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity, trichotomy and a notion
we call the ``weak minimal condition'' which is an analogue of well-foundedness broadened
so as not to entail reflexivity or antisymmetry.

Where useful notions, like the customary
definition of well-foundedness, entail more than one primitive notion, in this note,
the notion is expressed in terms of the chosen primitive ones and the customary definition
is proved as a theorem.

Section~\ref{Independence} contains proofs that the chosen primitive notions are
indeed independent, by proving that for each pair $P$ and $Q$ of primitive notions
their are examples where both hold, where $P$ holds and not $Q$ and where
$Q$ holds and not $P$. This material is not intended for inclusion in the theory {\it orders},
but rather to serve as a check on the chosen formalisation (as, in a different way, do
the proofs of Zorn's lemma and the well-ordering principle).
It also provides an exercise in semi-automated
bulk theorem-proving --- the challenge being to formulate and prove the desired results
without having to type in all 45 cases and all 45 witnesses.

For the convenience of anyone wanting to run this script on {\Product},
this note is a {\Product} literate script including
the code for all the proofs (most of which though present in the source is
supressed in the printed document).

The appendices include listings of the theory set up by the code in this document.
The theory (optionally) includes the existing theorems from the theory {\it orders}.
These comprise a body of results about down-sets which amount to the proof
of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion theorem and a collection of facts about
orders induced on a set equipped with a function mapping it to an ordered set.
These are all there to support the original aim of constructing the type of real numbers.

These existing theorems are followed by a couple of results that make our definition of
the minimum condition and of well-foundedness easier to work with.
Then come two lemmas leading up to Zorn's lemma (for which all the hard work
has been done elsewhere). This is then used (together with some lemmas about
subsets of ordered sets and extensions of well-ordered sets) to prove the
well-ordering principle. This material is followed by a selection of facts about
the minimum condition and well-foundedness to do with descending sequences
and induction. This is then specialised to the case where the field of the relation
in question is expected to be the universe of a type. Analogues of all the properties
are introduced for this case and the main results are specialised to it.
Finally come results that build up to the statement that our six
primitive notions are logically independent as mentioned above.

This document requires version 2.7.1 of {\Product} --- earlier versions of
the theory {\it orders} defined constants {\it PartialOrder} and {\it LinearOrder}
(now called {\it StrictPartialOrder} and {\it StrictLinearOrder}) which conflict
with constants defined here; later versions are likely to include the definitions
and many of the theorems already.

\section{SOME PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS}\label{SOME PROPERTIES OF RELATIONS}

The definitions below follow the spirit of the existing ones by not requiring
reflexivity or irreflexivity except where necessary. The intention is to make
the primitive notions logically independent of one another.

\subsection{Definitions of Primitive Properties}

The primitive notions that are there already are: irreflexivity, antisymmetry,
transitivity and trichotomy together with other notions such as density that are
more specific to the Dedekind-MacNeille completion construction and its
use in constructing the real numbers.
To these we add the notions of: reflexivity, and
the ``weak minimum condition'' (which says that every non-empty set contains a
minimal element in a certain sense).
In terms of these primitives we define derived notions such as well-foundedness.

=SML
open_theory "orders";
force_new_theory "ordered_sets";
new_parent "set_thms";
new_parent "rbjmisc";

val existing_defs = map get_spec (get_consts "orders");

set_merge_pcs["basic_hol", "'sets_alg", "'savedthm_cs_¶_proof"];
=TEX

Now we give definitions for the primitives not already defined.

This one, we now abstain from providing since it is in theory $equiv\_rel$ which is now a parent.

 ÷üüüüüü
 Ü µ (X, $<<)·
 Ü	Refl(X, $<<)
 Ü ¤	µx·x  X ´ x <<  x
 °
=TEX

We follow Cohn's Universal Algebra in using the term ``minimum condition''
for the condition that gives
well-foundedness of the ordered set formulated so that the ordering
relation need not be irreflexive. This is intended to accommodate
the varying conventions that are typically used in the literature for
well-ordered sets on the one hand and recursion with respect to
a well-founded relation on the other. However, this condition
entails that the relation is antisymmetric, so we take as primitive the following
weaker version.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛWeakMinCondÝ : ('a SET ¸ ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL)) ­ BOOL

Ü	¶x· x  A ± µy· y  A ± y << x ± ³ y = x ´ x << y

We now have our full set of primitives.

\subsection{Using the Definitions}

In this section we do a little preening on the definitions, including a
recasting of the definitions for the minimum condition and well-foundedness.

A relation has the minimum condition iff. every non-empty subset has a minimal
element (in the more usual sense).
We will almost invariably use this formulation in the sequel.
Well-foundedness can be rendered similarly, in this case expression of the minimality condition is simplfied by the fact that well-founded relations are by definition irreflexive.

\section{WELL-ORDERING}\label{WELL-ORDERING}

\subsection{Zorn's Lemma for Properties of Relations}

We already have Zorn's lemma in the special case where the ordered
set is some subset of the lattice of subsets of a set (and the ordering
relation is inclusion). We just need to ``interface'' with that theorem
by looking at the chains contained in an arbitrary relation.

\subsection{The Well-Ordering Principle}

The following lemma is needed in the proof of the well-ordering principle. It shows
that extending a well-ordering by adding an extra element above all the existing
elements gives a well-ordering.

The proof of the well-ordering is much as per Halmos.
Some care is needed to get the construction right and to avoid an embarrassment of case splits.
We have to exhibit a well-ordering on some arbitrary set $X$. Since subsets of well-ordered
sets are well-ordered it suffices to well-order the universe of the type of the elements of $X$.
To do this we define $U$ to be the set of all relations that well-order their field and
are reflexive on their field:

=SML
val u_def = ¬¶U·
	U =
	{	R : 'a ­ 'a ­ BOOL
	|	WellOrdering({a | R a a}, R) ± µa b· R a b ´ R a a ± R b b}®;
=TEX

$U$ is partial ordered by saying $R {<<<} S$ iff. $R$ is an Initial segment of $S$:

=SML
val segment_def = ¬¶$<<<· µR S: 'a ­ 'a ­ BOOL· 
		R <<< S
	¤	(µa b·R a b ´ S a b)
	±	(µa b·R a a ± ³R b b ± S b b ´ S a b)®;
=TEX

We then verify that $U$ and ${<<<}$ satisfy the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma:

=SML
val zorn_hyps =  ¬
		Trans(U : ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL) SET, $<<<)
	±	Antisym(U, $<<<)
	±	(µ C· C € U ± Trich (C, $<<<) ´
			(¶ x· x  U ± UpperBound (C, $<<<, x)))®;
=TEX

This verification, done naively would involve a large number of case splits in the situation
where we have two members $R$ and $S$ of a chain, so that either $R$ precedes $S$
or $S$ precedes $R$ --- one part of the formal proof would branch into 16 cases, if we proceeded
in the naive way. Instead, we use the following lemma which shows that any two elements, $R$ and $S$,
of a chain are both contained (viewed as sets of pairs) in some other element, $Q$. Of course,
$Q$ can be taken to be one or other of $R$ and $S$, but that does not matter for all but
one of the properties we have to prove.. This property is that the upper bounds
of chains satisfy the minimum condition, and the case split in question is unavoidable since the
arguments are essentially different for the two cases. 

=SML
val key_lemma =¬µR S : 'a ­ 'a ­ BOOL·
		R  C ± S  C
	´ 	¶Q·
		Q  C
	±	(µa b·R a b ´ Q a b )
	±	(µa b·S a b ´ Q a b )®;
=TEX

Once we have the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma, we apply it to produce a maximal element for
the initial segment relation and then prove that the field of such a maximal element must be
the whole set. Most of the work for this has been done in the previous theorem about
single element extensions of well-orderings.

\section{WELL-FOUNDEDNESS}\label{WELL-FOUNDEDNESS}

\subsection{The Minimum Conditions and Well-Founded Relations}

In this section we show the equivalence of our definitions with some other useful
conditions. This selection of equivalences is currently just a sample. We could,
for example, come up with induction principles characterising the minimum conditions.

A relation has the minimum condition iff. every descending sequence stabilises:

min_cond_descending_sequence_thm = ô µX $<<·
		MinCond(X, $<<)

When reasoning using well-founded induction a primitive induction principle can be converted into ``course of values'' induction by using the theorem which states that a relation is well-founded iff its transitive closure is well-founded.

In preparation for proving this theorem it is convenient to have a more general notion of inclusion of relations than that of section \ref{Lemmas about Subsets of Ordered Sets}.
This is helpful because a relation is a subrelation of its transitive closure, not a restriction of it to a smaller field.
This suffices to establish that it is well founded if its transitive closure is.
One might as well get it via the general result that subrelations of well-founded relation is well-founded, but it can't be done using a subrel theorem of the kind presented in section \ref{Lemmas about Subsets of Ordered Sets} earlier.

A relation is well-founded iff its transitive closure is well-founded.

In the right to left direction the result follows from the fact that a relation is a subrelation of its transitive closure and that a subrelation of a well-founded relation is well-founded.
In the left to right direction the proof involves showing by well-founded induction that there is no descending sequence in the transitive closure.

\subsection{The Well-founded Part of a Relation}

Relations which are not well-founded may have useful well-founded subrelations.

The well-founded part of a relation is the restriction of the relation to the subdomain of elements which are not the first element of any infinite descending sequence.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛWfPartÝ: ('a SET ¸ ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL)) ­ ('a SET ¸ ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL))

Ü	{x | x  X ± ³ ¶f· f 0 = x ± µn· (f n  X ± (f (n+1)) << f n)},

The well-founded part of a relation is of course, well-founded.

\subsection{The Recursion Theorem}

The recursion theorem asserts the existence of fixed points of functionals under certain circumstances.
This is helpful in establishing the consistency of inductive or recursive definitions of functions.
The basic idea is that a recursive definition will be consistent if the recursion is well-founded.

Exactly how the result is best formulated depends on how you want to use it.

In HOL a suitable version of the recursion theorem will be of general applicability in consistency proofs for recursive definitions of HOL functions, which are of course, total over some type, so this is a prime application.

A special variant on this is when a new type is being introduced, corresponding to a subset of some existing type) and one of the primitive operators on the new type is defined recursively.
Since the operator is primitive, it must be defined over a subset of the representation type and a version of the recursion theorem which yields a partial fixedpoint will be useful (a partial fixedpoint in this context is a total function which is fixed under the functional over some subset of its domain type).
Since this is a generalisation of the recursion theorem more commonly applicable, this is the version I prove here.

A third case of interest is the recursive specification of functions in Z.
In this case functions are represented as many-one relations.
Its not sensible to address this variant here because it needs to be done in a context suitable for reasoning about Z, best done in a separate document.

The existence of a fixed point of a functional depends upon the recursion embodied in the functional  being well-founded.
The following two definitions allow us to talk about this formally.

A functional ``FunctRespects'' (informally, respects) a relation over some set if it delivers a function whose value at some point in that set is dependent only on the values of the operand function at the points in the set related to x under the relation.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛFunctRespectsÝ: (('a ­ 'b) ­ ('a ­ 'b))
Ü		­ ('a SET ¸ ('a ­ 'a ­ BOOL)) ­ BOOL
÷üüüüüü
Ü µG (X, $<<)· FunctRespects G (X, $<<) ¤
Ü	µg h x· x  X ´ (µy· y  X ± y << x ´ g y = h y) ´ G g x = G h x
°

A functional is well-founded if it respects some well-founded relation, and in that case will have a fixed point.

It would be nice if one could obtain from a functional a relation which that functional respects.
I have unable to discover a way in which this can be done in the general case (other than the useless everywhere-true relationship, which has an empty well-founded part).

=IGN
A functional has a fixed point if its dependencies are well-founded (this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition).
A functional always has a partial fixed point which is fixed over the well-founded part of its dependency relation, which may be defined:

 ¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛWfDomainÝ: (('a ­ 'b) ­ ('a ­ 'b)) ­ 'a SET
 ÷üüüüüü
Ü µG· WfDomain G = Fst (WfPart (Universe, Dependencies G))

=TEX

To express a recursion theorem giving partial fixed points of a functional we define the notion of partial equivalence of functions.

¹HOLCONST
Ü ÛPartFunEquivÝ: 'a SET ­ ('a ­ 'b) ­ ('a ­ 'b) ­ BOOL

It may be helpful to have a proforma which facilitates proof that a function respects some well-founded relation.
One way of approaching this is to define a function which restricts some other function to the part of its domain strictly below some value.
These will be the values which are accessible to a function computing its value at that point which respects the relation.

Here I assume the relation is over the whole type.

\section{RELATIONS OVER A TYPE}\label{RELATIONSOVERATYPE}

The material in the next two sections is placed in a new theory {\it U\_orders}.

All of our definitions are explicit about the ordered set $X$ on which the property of
interest is required to hold. In many applications, $X$ will be the universe of a type
and the definitions and the statements of some of the theorems simplify.
The relevant definitions may be given concisely as follows:

¹HOLCONST
Ü	UIrrefl : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UAntisym : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UTrans : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UStrictPartialOrder : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UTrich : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UStrictLinearOrder : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UComplete : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	URefl : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UPartialOrder : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	ULinearOrder : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;

Ü	UMinCond : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UWellOrdering : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL;
Ü	UWellFounded : ('a  ­ 'a ­ BOOL) ­ BOOL
÷
Ü	UIrrefl = Curry Irrefl Universe 
Ü ±	UAntisym = Curry Antisym Universe
Ü ±	UTrans = Curry Trans Universe
Ü ±	UStrictPartialOrder = Curry StrictPartialOrder Universe
Ü ±	UTrich = Curry Trich Universe
Ü ±	UStrictLinearOrder = Curry StrictLinearOrder Universe
Ü ±	UComplete = Curry Complete Universe
Ü ±	URefl = Curry Refl Universe
Ü ±	UPartialOrder = Curry PartialOrder Universe

Now we automatically derive the defining properties of all of these constants
in terms of primitive notions or other constants in the set.

\section{INDEPENDENCE}\label{Independence}

We want to show that for any pair of the primitive notions, $P$ and $Q$,
there are relations for which both hold, $P$ holds but not $Q$ and $Q$ holds but not $P$.
Somewhat more subtly, we want to do this without assuming that the primitive notions
are distinct. (I.e., it is not good enough to assume that reflexivity and transitivity are
distinct notions, for example, when exhibiting a relation that has one property but
not the other).

The examples will all use relations on the natural numbers. The weak minimum condition
turns out to be the hardest property to prove in the examples; the following lemma serves
in all but one case (viz. weak minimum condition and not antisymmetry, for which, happily,
the relation that relates any two natural numbers does the job).

\ignore{

);

}%ignore

For the cases where we need to show that the primitive properties are compatible,
our example are be (with one exception), the usual order structure on the natural 
numbers in its reflexive or irreflexive guise. The exception turns out to be when
we have to exhibit a relation which is both reflexive and irreflexive.

Now we embark on a short series of portmanteau lemmas that will fit together
to give the desired results. The first lemma is the one where we actually
have to provide 20 specific witnesses to show that none of reflexivity,
antisymmetry, transitivity, trichotomy or the weak minimum condition entails
another. We formulate this as follows using numeric tags to avoid accidentally
assuming that the primitive notions are pairwise distinct.

We deal with irreflexive (resp. non-irreflexive) relations by reducing the required examples to a
reflexive (resp. non-reflexive) case. This occupies the next two lemmas, the proofs of which
show that this may be done by one construction in each case.
In the next lemma, we derive an irreflexive relation from a reflexive one by removing
the diagonal:

=SML
val Ûindependence_lemma2Ý = (
set_goal ([], ¬
µm· m  {1; 2; 3; 4} ´
let	props m =
	if	m = 1
	then	Antisym
	else if	m = 2
	then	Trans
	else if	m = 3
	then	Trich
	else	WeakMinCond
in	(¶X : î SET; $<< ·  Refl (X, $<<) ± ³props m (X, $<<))
´	(¶X : î SET; $<< · Irrefl (X, $<<) ± ³props m (X, $<<))
®);

	THEN rewrite_tac def_thms THEN REPEAT strip_tac
	THEN ¶_tac¬X® THEN ¶_tac¬Ìi j:î·³i = j ± i << j®
	THEN rewrite_tac[] THEN contr_tac 
	THEN_TRY SOLVED_T

a(cases_tac¬x = y® THEN1 all_var_elim_asm_tac);
a(cases_tac¬y = z® THEN1 all_var_elim_asm_tac);
a(rename_tac[] THEN all_asm_ufc_tac[] THEN_TRY all_var_elim_asm_tac);

a(rename_tac[] THEN all_asm_ufc_tac[]);
a(spec_nth_asm_tac 4 ¬x® THEN all_asm_ufc_tac[]);
save_pop_thm"independence_lemma2"
);
=TEX

And in the proof of the next lemma, we make a non-irreflexive relation by adding
in the diagonal (a.k.a., forming the reflexive closure). The hypothesis of non-reflexivity
is not necessary, but makes the result easier to user later on.

=SML
val Ûindependence_lemma3Ý = (
set_goal ([], ¬

	if	m = 1
	then	Antisym
	else if	m = 2
	then	Trans
	else if	m = 3
	then	Trich
	else	WeakMinCond
in	(¶X : î SET; $<< ·  props m (X, $<<) ± ³Refl(X, $<<))
´	(¶X : î SET; $<< · props m (X, $<<) ± ³Irrefl(X, $<<))

a(rewrite_tac[let_def]);
a(PC_T "sets_ext1"  (µ_tac THEN ´_tac) THEN_TRY all_var_elim_asm_tac
	THEN conv_tac (MAP_C î_eq_conv) THEN rewrite_tac[]

a(rename_tac[] THEN all_asm_ufc_tac[]);
a(spec_nth_asm_tac 3 ¬x'® THEN  all_asm_ufc_tac[]);
save_pop_thm"independence_lemma3"
);
=TEX

We now do some {\it ad hoc} forward proof that sucks the various cases out of the lemmas.
Step through this interactively to see what is going on here (roughly, specialise the
$m$ and $n$ in the lemmas to each numeric value for which the lemma says something
useful and then simplify the results to give the existential assertion saying that
an ordered set  of a particular kind exists).

=SML
val l1 = pc_rule1  "sets_ext1" rewrite_rule[let_def] independence_lemma1;
val l2 = pc_rule1  "sets_ext1" rewrite_rule[let_def] independence_lemma2;
val l3 = pc_rule1  "sets_ext1" rewrite_rule[let_def] independence_lemma3;

fun spec_lit th = rewrite_rule[] o conv_rule (MAP_C î_eq_conv) o switch µ_elim  th;

val ns0_4 = dest_enum_set ¬{0; 1; 2; 3; 4}®;
val ns1_4 = dest_enum_set ¬{1; 2; 3; 4}®;

val ths1 = flat (map (fn t => map (spec_lit t) ns0_4) (map (spec_lit  l1) ns0_4));
val ths2 = map (spec_lit l2) ns1_4;
val ths3 = map (spec_lit l3) ns1_4;
=TEX

Now the independence theorem can be stated and proved.
The above lemmas give 44 of the 45 cases.
The only case we have not dealt with is the compatibility of reflexivity and
irreflexivity (for which the witness is the empty ordered set).
=SML
val Ûindependence_thmÝ = (
set_goal ([], ¬
µm n· m  {0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5} ± n  {0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5} ´
let	props m =
	if	m = 0
	then	Refl
	else if	m = 1
	then	Antisym
	else if	m = 2
	then	Trans
	else if	m = 3
	then	Trich
	else if	m = 4
	then	WeakMinCond
	else	Irrefl
in	(³m = n  ´ ¶X : î SET; $<<· props m (X, $<<) ± ³props n (X, $<<))
±	(m < n ´ ¶X : î SET; $<< · props m (X, $<<) ± props n (X, $<<))
®);
a(rewrite_tac[let_def]);
a(PC_T1 "sets_ext1" REPEAT strip_tac THEN_TRY all_var_elim_asm_tac
	THEN conv_tac (MAP_C î_eq_conv) THEN rewrite_tac[]
	THEN bc_tac (ths2 @ ths3)
	THEN_TRY MAP_EVERY (TRY o accept_tac) ths1
	THEN_TRY (

ORELSE

	THEN ¶_tac¬{}® THEN rewrite_tac def_thms);
save_pop_thm"independence_thm"
);
=TEX

Finally, we do some forward proof to suck out a theorem that explicitly states
the 45 cases --- consult the theory listing or run through this interactively to
see the result. 

=SML
val i_th = pc_rule1  "sets_ext1" rewrite_rule[let_def] independence_thm;

val ns0_5 = dest_enum_set ¬{0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5}®;

val i_ths = flat (map (fn t => map (spec_lit t) ns0_5) (map (spec_lit  i_th) ns0_5));

val i_clauses = (pc_rule1"lin_arith" rewrite_rule[]) (list_±_intro ( i_ths));

val Ûindependence_clausesÝ = save_thm
	("independence_clauses",  conv_rule cnf_conv i_clauses);
