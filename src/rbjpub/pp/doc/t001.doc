\section{INTRODUCTION}

For context and motivation see \cite{rbjt000}.

This essay explores certain aspects of formal semantics, using formal notations and a tool (\Product) which supports the development of formal specifications and proofs.

The discussion hangs around concepts of analyticity (not {\it the} concept of analyticity, about which nothing is said).
Notions of analyticity are considered without reference to any particular language.
The discussion is in my best approximation to King's English, peppered by {\ProductHOL} formalese.
The formalised concepts are concepts of analyticity in languages which have, or at least {\it might} certain kinds of formal semantics.

My objectives in discussing this topic are to draw out certain points of interest among which are:

\begin{itemize}
\item that one is likely when attempting to make concepts more precise, to end up with concepts which are quite different, as one does in making the transition from talking of hot and cold to talking about temperature.
\item the notion of {\it looseness} and its interaction with concepts of analyticity
\item the question whether the interaction between formal models of semantics and formal concepts of analyticity suggests any useful classification of semantic models or of formal languages.
\end{itemize}

For the purposes of the discussion several different kinds of formal semantics are considered, each supporting the enunciation of particular notions of analyticity or related concepts.
It is not clear to me whether there are any useful relationships between these different kinds of formal semantics.

The focus on to notion of analyticity strongly influences the kind of formal semantics considered, the primary interest being in truth conditions.

All the conceptions of formal semantics considered here treat a semantics as a mathematical (or semantic) entity rather than a syntactic one.
This is perhaps unusual.
When we define concepts in terms of semantics it is more important to know what a semantics {\it is} than how it is written.
The distinction may possibly be illuminated by comparison with the advice that the construction of proofs in geometry should not be influenced by conclusions or intutions drawn from diagrams.
Just as some features of illustrative diagrams may be particular to the illustration rather than general to all the structures under consideration, some (possibly all!) features of a syntactic presentation of a semantics (such as Tarski's classic conception of a truth conditional semantics as a system of equivalence statements) may be peculiarities of that presentation rather than general features of, say, truth conditional semantics.

The informal conception of analyticity which I think closest to those defined below is that of the logical positivists, as criticised by Quine in his ``Two Dogmas of Empiricism'' which paper probably contains one of the clearest accounts of the concept.
Its may concisely be rendered:
\begin{quotation}
A sentence is analytic if it is true solely in virtue of its meaning.
\end{quotation}

but is better explained by Quine as follows:
\begin{quotation}
It is obvious that truth in general depends on both language and extra-linguistic fact. The statement `Brutus killed Caesar' would be false if the world had been different in certain ways, but it would also be false if the word `killed' happened rather to have the sense of `begat'. Thus one is tempted to suppose in general that the truth of a statement is somehow analysable into a linguistic component and a factual component.  Given this supposition it next seems reasonable that in some statements the factual component should be null; and that these are the analytic statements. 
\end{quotation}
Quine didn't think we should succumb to the temptation.
I would like to add just one more element to this explication, which concerns what is meant here by `fact', which should be understood to refer only to empirical facts rather than logical facts.
Of course, to understand this clarification you have first to understand the distinction which it is intended to clarify.
We are too close here to the foundations of semantics to escape from circularity.

I present in three models.
The first as simple as it can be made, which serves first to illustrate the distinction between a formal semantics as a {\it document} (or some other {\it syntactic} entity), and as a mathematical entity (such as a set or a function).

A discussion of the limitations of this first simple model leads to a more elaborate model which addresses the defects discussed.
Our primary concern is with the idea of

First of all, we must give the the ML commands to  introduce the new theory ``analytic'' as a child of the theory ``hol''.

\subsection{Defining Analyticity}

In this first formalisation of the concept of analyticity we construe a truth conditional semantics as a function which for any sentence delivers the property of conditions which is true of those conditions under which the sentence is true.

A sentence is analytic if its value under the semantics is that property of conditions which is always true. 
The `conditions' here should be thought of as factual {\it states of affairs} each condition encapsulating one possible complete account of what the (empirical) facts are.
An analytic sentence is then a sentence which is true whatever the conditions.
