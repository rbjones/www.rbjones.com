\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Some Themes}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Some Themes}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item The Automation of Deduction! (architecture, foundations, applications...)

\paws{}\item "Leibniz's Project"

\mode<article>{
- his {\it universal characteristic} and {\it calculus ratiocinator}.
}

\paws{}\item ARG "philosophy"

\mode<article>{
- some philosophical positions explicit or implicit in the work of the Cambridge Automated Reasoning Group contrasted with those prevalent in contemporary academic philosophy
}

\paws{}\item mixed marriages

\mode<article>{
- sometimes a problem arising in one discipline, which demands a solution in another, requires and stimulates inovative solutions.
Intuitions arising from the problem may facilitate that innovation.
}

\paws{}\item interplay between philosophical and technical problems

\mode<article>{
- one mode of philosophising is to take an important but muddy problem and to find formal ways of making it more precise
}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Leibniz and His Project}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Leibniz (1646 -1716)}

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item .. an intellectual innovator of the first rank, his work included:

\begin{itemize}
\item A philosophical system which was "unusually coherent and complete". (Russell)

\mode<article>{
Mostly in scattered fragments not discovered for centuries and hence not very influential.
The single most substantial document was his Monadology.
}
\item The integral and differential calculus.

\mode<article>{
This was probably the most influential of Leibniz's innovations.
Newton first discovered the calculus, but Leibniz discovered it independently and published it fors (1684), and his notation proved much more convenient so that the subsequent development of the mathematics took place primarily in continental Europe using his notation.
Failure to adopt Leibniz's notation marginalised English mathematics for some time.
}

\item A calculating machine.

\mode<article>{
Calculators capable of addition and subtraction had already been developed before Leibniz.
Leibniz designed a calculator to do multiplication and division, and made innovations which later became standard, for example, the stepped reckoner (or "Leibniz wheel"), which had cogs of varying lengths.
He presented a model of one of his calculators to the Royal Society on a visit to London in 1673.
}

\item Many grand and unrealistic schemes, including one for the automation of reason.
\end{itemize}

\paws{}\item
He was "an encyclopedic savant whose philosophy was nourished by the study of all the sciences and in turn inspired all of his scientific discoveries" (Couturat)

\paws{}\item
"Mathematicians have as much need to be philosophers as philosophers have to be mathematicians." (Leibniz)

\paws{}\item
Inspired:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frege's {\it Begriffschrift},
\item Russell's work on {\it Principia} and other aspects of his philosophy
\item (indirectly) Carnap's philosophical programme, including the formalisation of physics.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Leibniz's Grand Projects}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item Universal Mathematics

\mode<article>{
\begin{quote}
Since happiness consists in peace of mind, and since durable peace of mind depends on the confidence we have in the future, and since that confidence is based on the science we should have of the nature of God and the soul, it follows that science is necessary for true happiness.

But science depends on demonstration, and the discovery of demonstrations by a certain Method is not known to everybody. For while every man is able to judge a demonstration (it would not deserve this name if all those who consider it attentively were not convinced and persuaded by it), nevertheless not every man is able to discover demonstrations on his own initiative, nor to present them distinctly once they are discovered, if he lacks leisure or method. 

The true Method taken in all of its scope is to my mind a thing hitherto quite unknown, and has not been practised except in mathematics. It is even very imperfect in regard to mathematics itself, as I have had the good fortune to reveal by means of surprising proofs to some of those considered to be among the best mathematicians of the century. And I expect to offer some samples of it, which perhaps will not be considered unworthy of posterity.
\end{quote}
[From: The Method of Mathematics - preface to the General Science, G.W. Leibniz] 
}

\paws{}\item The General Science

\paws{}\item Universal Encyclopaedia

\mode<article>{
Leibniz sought the collaborative development of an encyclopaedia in which would be presented in non-symbolic form all that was so far known. This was to provide a basis for the lingua characteristica in which the knowledge could be formally expressed. This enterprise was not completed, but beneficial side effects were the foundation of new academies and of the journal Acta Eruditorum.
}

\paws{}\item Universal Language

\mode<article>{
he promoted the development of a language universal in the sense of being spoken by all. There have been many such projects of which the best known today is esperanto
}

\paws{}\item Academies and Journals

\mode<article>{
Leibniz was involved in many schemes for setting up academies.
His main efforts were for academies in Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and St Petersburg, but others included Mainz, Hanover, Hamburg and Poland.

He was involved in the founding pf the journal Acta Eruditorum in 1682 and much later, in 1700, he started his own journal, the Monatliche Auszug.
}

\paws{}\item Universal Characteristic and Calculus Ratiocinator

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item all knowledge formally expressible using the universal characteristic
\paws{}\item all disputes resolvable by computation using the calculus ratiocinator
\end{itemize}

\mode<article>{
The {\it universal characteristic} or {\it lingua characteristica} was to be a language in which predicates were numerically encoded in such a way as to render the truth of subject predicate proposition (and Leibniz considered all propositions to have this form) could be obtained by arithmetical computation.

The {\it calculus ratiocinator} was to be a calculus which permitted the truth of any sentence in the lingua characteristica to be computed (possibly by a machine).
Leibniz believed that every predicate was either simple or complex and that complex predicates could be analysed into simple constituents.
He proposed to assign prime numbers to each simple predicate and then represent a complex predicate by the product of the primes representing its simple constituents (complex predicates are therefore invariably conjunctions of finite numbers of simple predicates).
He also believed that every proposition had subject predicate form, and that in a true proposition the predicate was contained in the subject, i.e. the set of simple predicates from which the predicate was composed was a subset of the set from which the subject was composed.
This can be sorted out by numerical computation, you just check whether the predicate divides the subject without remainder.

His main difficulty in this was in discovering what the simple predicates are.
Leibniz thought the complete analysis beyond mere mortals, but believed that a sufficient analysis (into predicates which are relatively primitive) for the purposes of the calculus ratiocinator would be realisable.
From this it appears that Leibniz expected his language and calculus to be not completely universal.
}

\paws{}\item Should we take this (characteristic and calculus) seriously?

\begin{enumerate}
\paws{}\item as an alternative to "the singularity"

\mode<article>{
This is an idea of Vernor Vinge, one among many along the lines that global AI will emerge outside our control and take over.

\begin{quote}
"Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence.
Shortly after, the human era will be ended."
\end{quote}

}

\paws{}\item to establish the domain in which machines can be authoritative and make sure that they are reliable where they can be

\paws{}\item as promoting systematisation and simplification

\mode<article>{
In academic research innovation is prized over mere reorganisation.
This has many detrimental effects.
}

\paws{}\item ...
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Philosophical Context}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{ARG "philosophy"}

Some pragmatic philosophical positions which appear to be endemic to the Cambridge Automated Reasoning Group.

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item Pragmatic Foundationalism

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item
There are good practical reasons for doing formal deduction in the context of a "foundation system".

\mode<article>{
There are probably many examples of this in the publications of the ARG, e.g. Paulson on datatypes.
}

\paws{}\item I.e. a system in which one can work by {\it conservative extension}.

\paws{}\item Getting deductive inference right is not enough, need to ensure that the context is coherent.
\end{itemize}

\paws{}\item Deduction alone tells us nothing about anything physical.

\mode<article>{
See Avra Cohn on the verification of the Viper processor.
She anticipates the criticism that formal proofs about the behaviour of hardware are impossible and explains that the verification of the microprocessor involves reasoning about abstract models of a processor which capture the design of the processor.
Fetzer's "Program Verification: The Very Idea" was probably just out.
This will may establish that the design is correct, but not that any physical realisation of the design will perform correctly.
}

\paws{}\item But we can reason about reality using formal (abstract) models.

\paws{}\item To get your proof system sound its a good idea to have a semantics.

\mode<article>{
Very early versions of HOL had insufficient checks on polymorphic definitions to ensure that they are conservative.
After discovering this it was decided that a mathematical semantics would be a good idea.
}

\paws{}\item A natural place to give the semantics of a foundation system is in set theory (e.g. Pitts and Arthan),

\mode<article>{
The semantics of HOL in set theory written by Andy Pitts is now (long past) part of the HOL documentation.
A formal semantics was done by Rob Arthan using ProofPower-HOL.
}

\paws{}
Hence:

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item For establishing deductive soundness, abstract semantics suffices...
\paws{}\item even if we want to reason about the real world.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interpreting Leibniz's Project Today}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item {\Large Lingua Characteristica}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item Since Principia Mathematica we have had pragmatically universal languages for abstract modelling,

\paws{}\item e.g. Higher Order Set Theory,

\paws{}\item but a modern ``solution'' would be pluralistic.

\paws{}\item Coherence is realisable through a common semantic framework.

\paws{}\item The problem translates into one of methods for construction of large models in diverse languages.

\paws{}\item A common universal semantic foundation remains desirable.

\mode<article>{
There are interesting philosophical problems here.
It is commonly doubted that there could be such a thing, even for abstract semantics.
However, the concepts involved have not been sufficiently precisely defined for the question to ahve a definite answer (what is a language, what is a semantics, what does it mean to say that the semantics of one language is definable in another).
This is not sophistical hair splitting, its a real issue.
These issues connect with the practical question of how a logical system revolving around semantics resolves the problem of semantic regress.
For one answer, see below under semantics.
}

\end{itemize}

\paws{}\item {\Large Calculus Ratiocinator}

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item Since the invention of the digital computer we have universal calculating machines.

\paws{}\item We also have near complete formal deductive systems (though not a decision procedure of course).

\paws{}\item Tractability remains a problem.

\paws{}\item A universal framework in which the scope of automated and semi-automated inference will continue to broaden.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\section{Architecture}

\subsection{What is Architecture?}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is Architecture?}

An architecture should supply:

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item The most important high level requirements

\paws{}\item A high level model of the system sufficient to expose...

\paws{}\item A rationale showing how or why the system will meet the requirements,

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item {\Large Soundness}

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item
An architecture for automated deductive reasoning, must of course be {\it deductive}.

\paws{}\item So what does that mean?

\paws{}\item
A demonstration is {\it deductive} if it accomplished exclusively by the use of {\it sound} rules of inference.

\paws{}\item
Therefore, the system be sound,

\paws{}\item and each language used must have a well-defined semantics.
\end{itemize}

\paws{}\item {\Large Functionality, Performance, Assurance}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item The architecture should allow flexibility in trade-offs between these features.

\mode<article>{
 We now know that there can be no decision procedure and that many problems are computationally intractible.
}

\paws{}\item We should expect a long period in which real problems are solved by people with machine assistance.

\paws{}\item Should be good for formalisation of mathematics and formalisable science.

\paws{}\item Economic driver / long term goal: The Automation of Design.

\paws{}\item
Where there is no requirement for high assurance, performance should be close to that for non-logical methods.

\paws{}\item Assurance should be flexible and known.

\mode<article>{
The idea is that the user is able to chose where he wants to be in the functionality/performance/assuracnce trade-offs.
If you don't need absolute certainty you can set the standard low and get results faster and cheaper.
The important thing is that you can get high assurance when you need it and you know what you are getting.
}

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{A Formal Model}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A Formal Architectural Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Document oriented
\item Multilingual
\item Assurance Calculus
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsubsection{Abstract Syntax}

\mode<article>{
The abstract syntax of our metalanguage is defined using a datatype in isabelle HOL.

The language is about documents (which are understood as propositions) expressed in various object languages, and programs (whose computations are interpreted as inferences) which read documents and create new documents.
These things have to be uniquely identified in a global context, and that's what URI's (Universal Resource Identifiers) are for, so that's what we call them.
So we begin with a type abbreviation indicating that URI's are to be represented by strings, and that various other things are given by URI's.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{A Model}
=GFT
types URI = string
   document = URI
   language = URI
   program = URI
   authority = URI
=TEX

Here:
\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item URI stands for Universal Resource Identifier but may also include a digest of the resource referred to.
\paws{}\item A document may be any static representation of information which has a semantics, e.g. an XML document, a snapshot of a view of a database.
\paws{}\item Think of a language as encompassing a context, and a document as potentially creating a new context (like a theory).
\paws{}\item Any program for which a specification is ``known'' counts as a sound inference rule.
\paws{}\item We do not seek absolute assurance, sets of authorities serve as assurance levels.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Sentences and Judgements}

\mode<article>{
The subject matter of the metalanguage is the truth of documents.
The metalanguage permits the establishment (proof) of truth to be compounded from inferences performed by a variety of programs in various languages.
From premises about the inferences performed by these various programs (which may be thought of as demonstrating lemmas) it is to be possible in the metalanguage to infer an overall conclusion.
}


The language contains sentences which express the claims that:

\begin{enumerate}
\paws{}\item certain documents are true documents of particular languages
\paws{}\item a certain program satisfies a specification formulated as soundness with respect to given lists of input and output languages
\paws{}\item a specified list of output documents was computed by a program from a list of input documents
\end{enumerate}
\paws{}
=GFT
datatype sentence =
 	TrueDocs "document list" "language list"	
|	ProgSpec program "language list" "language list"
|	Compute  program "document list" "document list"
=TEX

\mode<article>{
In general sentences are not proven absolutely, but on the assurance of various authorities (sometimes called oracles).
The combination of a sentence with a set of authorities which have contributed to our grounds for asserting the sentence is called a "judgement".
For reasons connected with well-definedness of the semantics of judgements a judgement also contains a number.
This may be thought of as a time-stamp, but is more loosely specified.
}
\paws{}
Judgements either assert sentences or endorse authorities:
\paws{}
=GFT
types stamp = nat

datatype judgement =
    Assert stamp "authority set" sentence |
    Endorse authority "authority set"
=TEX

\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Semantics}

\mode<article>{

The set of authorities can be empty, but when asserted a judgement must be signed by an authority.
The meaning of a judgement is that {\it if} all the authorities cited in the list have been hitherto infallible then the sentence is true.

However, the judgement is known only with that degree of confidence which we attach to the authority which asserts it (and has signed it), so even an unconditional judgement (one with an empty set of cited authorities) is still no better assured than its signing authority.

An authority has been "hitherto infallible" if all the judgements which it has signed with numbers less than that of the judgement in hand are true.
In fallibility and truth are therefore mutually defined, the numbers attached to judgements relativise infallibility so as to make the mutual recursion well-founded.
}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Sentence Interpretations}

To interpret a sentence we need to know:
\begin{enumerate}
\paws{}\item the content of the documents
\paws{}\item the semantics of the languages
\paws{}\item the functions computed by the programs
\end{enumerate}
\paws{}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Judgement Interpretations}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item
A judgement is true if infallibility of its authorities implies the truth of its sentence.

\paws{}\item
To determine truth we therefore need to know what judgements have been asserted by each authority.

\end{itemize}

\paws{}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Infallibility and Truth - I}

\mode<article>{
Informally an authority is infallible if it only asserts true judgements.
However, the definition of truth of a judgement will depend upon the infallibility of authorities, and this naive view does not lead to a well defined concept.

This is fixed by slighly {\it strengthening} the meaning of judgements, so that their truth depends only on the truth of {\it previous} judgements, and it is for this reason that judgements have been given a "stamp".
This leads us to the property of being "hitherto infallible" at some stamp value.
This is the property that all judgements affirmed by the authority with smaller stamp values are true.

One further complication is necessary, arising from endorsement.
The infallibility of an authority is conditional on the infallibility of the authorities it has endorsed in a way which cannot be allowed for by attaching a truth value to the judgement in which the endorsement takes place.
This is because the truth value of the endorsement can only depend on that of previous judgements, but the infallibility of an authority at some time depends on judgements made by authorities he has endorsed between the time at which the endorsement took place and the later time at which an infallibility judgement may be taking place.

Endorsements are therefore held to create a timeless partial ordering on authorities, and we require for the infallibility of an authority at some moment that neither he nor any greater authority has made a previous error.
Greater in this case means directly or indirectly endorsed by the authority in question.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Foundations}

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item Semantics and consistency are crucial.

\paws{}\item Abstract semantics suffices for deductive soundness.

\paws{}\item If we require each language to have a formal abstract semantics, then there will be a problem of semantic regress.

\paws{}\item Hence we need foundations for abstract semantics, where the buck stops.

\paws{}\item Well-Founded sets provide the most plausible universal foundation.

\paws{}\item This can also serve as the last resort on questions of consistency.

\paws{}\item Does not provide the best language in which to do mathematics.

\frametitle{Well-Founded Set Theoretic Truth}

Here is a concise and definite semantics for well-founded Set theory:

\begin{itemize}

\paws{}\item a well-founded set is a definite collection of well-founded sets

\paws{}\item an interpretation of set theory is a transitive well-founded set

\paws{}\item a sentence is false if the collection of interpretations in which it is true is definite

\paws{}\item a sentence is true if the collection of interpretations in which it is false is definite

\end{itemize}

\paws{}
This semantics:

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item is maximally rich (large cardinal axioms are true)
\paws{}\item is definite (CH has a truth value, particular facts about cardinal arithmetic have truth values)
\paws{}\item ZFC is neither true nor false
\paws{}\item is not limited to first order languages (will work for infintary set theory)
\paws{}\item is self defining (conjecture)

\section{The Formalisation of Physics}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Formalisation of Physics}

Three subproblems:
\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item Methodological

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item Rudolf Carnap worked on the formalisation of physics.

\paws{}\item The naive ARG approach seems in many respects superior to the methods Carnap writes about.

\paws{}\item David Hestenes advocates a modelling approach to mathematical physics.

\paws{}\item His notion of model is woolly by comparison to the notion of a formal model.

\paws{}\item There is therefore some point in articulating ARG-like methods for a wider audience.

\end{itemize}


\paws{}\item Metaphysical

Can formal techniques help to separate the physical content of a scientific theory from the metaphysical?

\paws{}\item Mathematical

\begin{itemize}
\paws{}\item Formalisation make certain mathematical issues more significant.
\paws{}\item Issues raised by David Hestenes in his promotion of geometric algebra seem relevant to the formalisation of physics.
\paws{}\item There is a substantial subproblem of how to organise formal mathematics for physics.

Research physicists have no incentive to restructure the mathematical basis for theoretical physics.
The have aquired the mathematics they need for their special research and changes to the mathematical basis would be a distraction from their research.
David Hestenes has advocated geometric algebra for decades with little impact, and now does so on pedagogical grounds as a part of a programme of Physics Education Research.

Formalisation, like education, benefits from the elimination of spurious variety.
