\section{Postscript}\label{POSTSCRIPT}

I have now worked through the main body of Linnebo's paper.
Two appendices contain further technical information.
The first is set theoretic, and at first glance uncontroversial, so I shall probably not formally validate it.
The second gives more details of the modal/plural set theory, and at first glance says some surprising things not consistent with this formal treatment.
It would be a good idea to give some attention to this.

Beyond these technical details there is then the question of assessing what has been achieved.
I will probably write a bit about this.
