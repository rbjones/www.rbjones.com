\section{Postscript}\label{POSTSCRIPT}

I have now worked through the main body of Linnebo's paper, and the second of his two appendices.

The first apendix is different in character, obtaining a result stated in terms of plural set theory for which an equivalent theorem is uncontroversial in ZFC, I shall not attempt to formalise this proof.

The second appendix gives more details of and results in the modal/plural set theory.
Much of this is metatheoretic.
It would be possible to treat this more fully within the bounds of the syntax-free methods I have adopted, but this would be significantly more complex and time consuming than any of the other material so far undertaken, for relatively little further benefit.

Beyond these technical details there is then the question of the philosophical significance both of Linnebo's paper and of this kind of formal treatment.

There are then some problems in relation to the semantics of set theory not addressed by Linnebo which might benefit from the modal approach, and I may possibly add further material on these matters.
