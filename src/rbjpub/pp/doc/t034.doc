\begin{abstract}
Discussion of ``a semantics'' for first order set theory which is definable in set theory construed by this semantics.
Most of the literature in this area is related to the Liar paradox, which is of interest here only insofar as it has been supposed that the Liar paradox renders impossible this kind of construction (though the situation is now known to be rather complex).

\section{INTRODUCTION}

What I aim to discuss in this document is an approach to defining a semantics for the language of first order set theory from within that theory as construed by that semantics.
By ``a semantics'' I mean here simply a truth predicate, which, since we are in set theory, and the collection in question is countable, this is just a set.

The set we will define will be the set of true sentences in first order set theory.
The false sentences will be those whose negation is true.
It is not to be expected that if a sentence is not in this collection then its negation will be, some sentences will be left in limbo, with effectively no truth value.

The set theory for which we supply a semantics is a well-founded set theory, and by the methods used here could have been rendered as a theory like ZFC with large cardinal axioms.
However, global properties of the universe of discourse are not important to us here, and matters are simpler if we settle for less in that department.

In what ways does this semantics differ from the {\it normal} semantics for first order set theory?
The answer to this is, not at all in any aspect which is normally addressed, but that this does not usually include a definite truth valuation at the sentence level, which is all that is novel in this approach.
 
Semantics is not greatly discussed by mathematical logicians (among whom set theorists are usually counted).
Model theory is, and this provides the purely logical part of the semantics of `first order languages'.
This gives the truth conditions for the formulae of first order set theory and hence for sentences (closed formulae), relative to some given `interpretation' of the language (viz. membership structure).
However, it is not usual to nominate any particular interpretation, and so the semantics of set theory is left open at the level of judgemenmts.

There is an informal account of the intended interpretation of first order set theory, which is known as the cumulative heirarchy, however this involves a transfinite construction which cannot (on pain of contradiction) ever be completed.
One needs only to take this just so far to get a model of ZFC, so the fact that it can never be completed is not necessarily a matter for great concern.
However, we will worry about it a bit here.

The cumulative heirarchy was a good intuitive guide to the meaning of first order set theory only during the first half of the twentieth century.
Since then, technical developments have pushed the culture of set theorists away from such vague informalities, and towards a more formalisitic attitude towards set theory.
Powerful techniques were devised for proving independence results, and many logicians now regard a problem in set theory not as the determination of whether some first order conjecture is true, but rather as determining whether it is derivable from, refutable by or independent of the axioms of ZFC.
