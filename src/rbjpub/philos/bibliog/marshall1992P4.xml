<subsec title="Josiah Warren">
<p>
Josiah Warren, a musician and inventor, has been likened in his anarchism to Proudhon.
</p>
<p>
He was a member of Robert Owen's utopian colony <i>New Harmony</i>, and went on to found a several anarchistic utopian communities.  
</p><p>
Warren enunciated a principle of the sovereignty of the individual as follows:
<blockquote>
"SOCIETY MUST BE SO CONSTRUCTED AS TO PRESERVE THE <i>SOVEREIGNTY OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL</i> INVIOLATE.
That it must avoid all combinations and connection of persons and interests , and all other arrangements, which will not leave every individual at all times at LIBERTY to dispose of his or her person, and time, and property, in any manner in which his or her feelings or judgement may dictate, WITHOUT INVOLVEING THE PERSONS OR INTERESTS OF OTHERS.
"</blockquote>
In his <i>Equitable Commerce</i> (1846), he argued that each person should be the final judge of right amd wrong.
