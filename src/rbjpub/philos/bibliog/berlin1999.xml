<subsec title="Introduction">
There are three elements of Herder's thought which qualify him as a father of Romanticism, his ideas about expressionism, the notion of belonging, and the idea that true ideals may be incompatible. 
</subsec>
<subsec title="Expressionism">
<p>
The idea here is that self expression is a fundamental function of human beings.
Whatever a man does expresses his whole nature unless he maims himself by inhibition or self-constraint.
In this view Herder follows Haman.
</p><p>
There is a here a new attitude towards works of art, which again belongs both to Haman and Herder.
Hitherto (and for most people even to the present day) works of art were valued primarily for what they were nothing to do (according to Berlin) with who made them or why they were made.
For Haman and Herder a work of art is an expression of the whole being of the artist and is valued as such.
</p><p>
The whole being of an artists, does of course include his cultural identity.
</p>

<sbcol>
<subsec title="Belonging">
Herder's ideas about belonging appear at least in part to be elaborations of his ideas about the expressive character of works of art.
Some works of art are the product of individuals, others of groups.
