<subsec title="I. The extensional metalanguage for semantics">
<p>
Here Carnap describes not the language but rather what is to be done with the language.
This consists of definitions of the following:
<ul>
<li>rules of formation (syntactic)</li>
<li>rules of relative designation (these give tbe designation of some phrase of the language relative to some model and value assignment)</li>
<li>rules of direct designation (which gives a model for the language)</li>
<li>definition of truth (a sentence is true if it designates truth in the model given by the rules of direct designation according to the rules of relative designation)</li>
<li>meaning postulates (these are axioms which express relations between the descriptive constants)</li>
</ul>
A model is said to be <i>admissible</i> if all the meaning postulates hold in it.
</p><p>
Analyticity (A-truth) is then defined as follows:
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="II. Models, model structures and interpretations">
<p>
Carnap's terminology differs here from the terminology which I am accustomed to.
</p>
<p>
In my usage an interpretation is an assignment of values to the domains of quantification and the contants in some language (the details depend upon the kind of language under consideration), a model is an interpretation which satisfies the axioms of the theory.
</p><p>
In Carnap's usage a model is what I call an interpretation, a model structure is an isomorphism class of models. and an interpretation is some kind of definition of a model so that two distinct interpretations might describe the same model.
Two interpretations are the same if they are logically equivalent.
