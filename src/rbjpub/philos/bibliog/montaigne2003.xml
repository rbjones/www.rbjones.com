<subsec title="0 Introduction">
The subheadings used below are those of the translator.

<subsec title="1 Sebond and His Book">
Montaigne describes Sebond's book as written in Spanish "scrambled up with latin endings", and explains how the book came to be in the possession of his father and that his father asked him to translate it into French.
After this background Montaigne offers high praise to the book and then questions it originality, noting that one Adrianus Turnebus suggested to him that it was "some quintessence extracted from St. Thomas Aquinas".

The first objection is that it is harmful to defend religion by reason since it is conceived by faith and through divine grace.
