<section title="Essays, Book II, no.12 - Apology for Raymond Sebond" tag="EII12">
<abstract>
A book length essay ostensibly in defence of Sebond's book "Natural Theology".
The principle plan for the "defence" seems to be sceptical, rather than arguing for the propositions of natural theology Montaigne argues that man and his reason is too paltry to yield knowledge and we need God to help us out in these matter.
This essays therefore seems to contain the most extended exposition of Montaigne's scepticism.

<subsec title="0 Introduction">
The subheadings used below are those of the translator.
</subsec>
<subsec title="1 Sebond and His Book">
Montaigne describes Sebond's book as written in Spanish "scrambled up with latin endings", and explains how the book came to be in the possession of his father and that his father asked him to translate it into French.
After this background Montaigne offers high praise to the book and then questions it originality, noting that one Adrianus Turnebus suggested to him that it was "some quintessence extracted from St. Thomas Aquinas".

The first objection is that it is harmful to defend religion by reason since it is conceived by faith and through divine grace.

This is quite an extended essay copious with evidence of the sophistication of animals, of evidences of their intelligence, and indeed of pretty much all the attributes in which humans sometimes think themselves distinguished from animals.
