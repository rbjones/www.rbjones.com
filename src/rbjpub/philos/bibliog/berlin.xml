<p>
The title of this essay arises from its having been commissioned as a review of the second volume of Churchill's war memoires.
It is not particular to 1940.
It provides an interesting analysis of the character of Churchill, shedding some light on his peculiar qualitifcations for his role in the second world war.
</p><p>
Berlin usually has one or two axes to grind, it is this in part that gives his essays grip.
Often, however, I remain unconvinced, as in this case.
</p><p>
In discussing the way in which Churchill spoke for the nation during these times, Berlin perceives that Churchill was not a man exceptionally endowed with that kind of sensitivity which would inform him of the present sentiment.
He was endowed with a great sense of history, but as to the present he was more a man to create a sentiment and inspire it in others that to express what might already have been there.
</p><p>
Berlin speaks as if the idea of one man speaking for the nation should normally be taken at face value, and that such spokesmanship is a mediating role.
I find that hard to believe.

Berlin says of Churchill:</p>
<blockquote>
"If he did not represent the quintessence and epitome of what some at any rate of his fellow citizens feared and hoped in their hour of danger, this was because he idealised them with such intensity that in the end they approached his ideal and began to see themselves as he saw them 'the buoyant and imperturbable temper of Britain which I had the honour to express' - it was indeed, but he had a lion's share in creating it."
</blockquote>
<p>
i.e. He didn't so much divine or embody the sentiment of the nation, as create it.
</p><p>
I had this slight sense of wonderment that Berlin should find this remarkable, but reading on after this moment of dissent I am swept off my reserve by the description which follows of what it is for a great man to approach a moment in history at which he is destined to fulfil a purpose for which his entire life has been a preparation. 
</p><p>
A significant part of this review is devoted to comparison of Churchill with Roosevelt and to their relationship.
</p><p>
This review certainly made me feel that I would like to read the book.
As it happens I probably wont, that's not the way I'm heading right now.
