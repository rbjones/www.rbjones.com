For if praise is given to the men who have determined the number of regular solids - which is of no use except insofar as it is pleasant to contemplate - and if it is thought to be an exercise worthy of a mathematical genius tohave brought to light the more elegant properties of aconcoid or cissoid, or some other figure which rarely has any use, how much better will it be to bring under mathematical laws human reasoning which is the most excellent and useful thing we have.
