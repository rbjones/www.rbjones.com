<sbcol>
<subsec>
I am looking at this book mainly because it might be relevant to my present interests on the basis of what Brian Magee said about Schopenhsuer in an interview of Iris Murdoch on philosopy and literature which he gave on British television in the 70's, also published as the book <i>Men of Ideas [<bibref name="Magee78"/>]</i>.

<subsec>
Magee listed Schopenhauer as one of just four philosophers who "wrote well", and the only philosopher who has had a positive attitude towards art.
Since I have recently started thinking of Philosophy as an art form, I though it worth taking a look.
