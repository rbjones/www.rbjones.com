<section title="Editor's Preface">
<abstract>
".. the ur-text or 'torso', as Berlin called it, from which a great deal of his subsequent work was derived .."
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="">
The book is the 'torso' of a book, never completed, intended to accompany the Flexner Lectures which Berlin gave at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, in the spring of 1952.
It is the longest continuous text he ever wrote, at over 100 thousand words, his subsequent work being primarily in the form of essays.
This editor's preface is the story of how the work came to be written and published.

<subsec title="The Subject of the Lectures">
In a letter to the President of Bryn Mawr Berlin writes:
<blockquote>
"What I should like to talk about is the different fundamental approaches to social and political problems, e.g.
<ul>
<li>the Utilitarian;</li>
<li>that of the Enlightenment (rational and sentimental) from the Encyclopaedia to the French Revolution;</li>
<li>the Authoritarian-Reactionary (Maistre and his allies);</li>
<li>the Romantic;</li>
<li>the technocratic-scientific (Saint-Simon and his followers); and perhaps</li>
<li>the Marxist"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
In these we find stated, with greater vigour and clarity, the principles which lie behind contemporary political debate.

<section title="Isaiah Berlin's Political Ideas" tag="ibpi">
<abstract>
An introduction to the book, and its place in Berlin's work, by Joshua L. Cherniss.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="">
<p>
Interesting in placing this work relative to Berlin's other books, this being an early work covering ground over which Berlin passed many times.
The material here is only partly specific to this book and serves also as a more general account of Berlin's work.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="The Influence of Political Thought and Berlin's Sense of Place">
Berlin said in 1958:
<blockquote>
"there has, perhaps, been no time in modern history when so large a number of human beings [...]
 have had their notions, and indeed their lives so deeply altered, and in some cases violently upset, by fanatically held social and political doctrines."
</blockquote>
Berlin conceived his own role as that of understanding the influence of such men, exposing their errors, and of providing a clearer and truer understanding of reality.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Political Philosophy and History">
<blockquote>
"{E]ach poltical philosophy responds to the needs of its own times and is fully intelligible only in terms of all the relevant factors of its age, and intelligible to us only to the degree to which (and it is a far larger one than some modern relativists wish to persuade us that it is) we have experience in common with previous generations."
</blockquote>
Theories arising in different historical contexts are <i>incommensurable</i>.
</subsec>
<subsec title="The Significance of The Period of Interest">
<p>
The period in question is that around the French Revolution, roughly centred on the turn of the nineteenth century.
This is the period according to Berlin in which the terms of contemporary political discourse were established, in which the concepts, language, images and metaphors were generated.
Berlin claims here (but had seemed previously to deny) that the issues debated were "literlly identical" with those of his time (then the 1950s).
</p>
<p>
To the influence of the Enlightenment are traced both liberalism and communism.
Rousseau, seen both as an adherent and a passionate critic of the Enlightenment, breaking with its materialism and scientism, but not with its rationalism or its belief in the compatibility of liberty and order, was the intellectual progenitor of individualism, authoritarianism, nationalism and freedom-fighters.

<subsec title="Conceptions of Liberty">
<p>
Though not explicitly focused on liberty, it is central to Berlin's account.
The central question of political philosophy, he writes here, is that of liberty and obedience (why should anyone obey anyone else?).
