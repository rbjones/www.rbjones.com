My comments initially are on the parts which were selected for publication in a
collection called "A Priori knowledge" edited by Paul K.Moser.
These are: pp34-39, 48-60, 53-58, 99-105 and 108-109.
They are clearly identified below, in the context of the lecture of which they
are a part.

<subsec title="A Priori">
<p>
Kripke devotes one paragraph to explaining the concept of the <i>a priori</i>
and ends with the view that it might be best:
<quote>".. to stick to the question of whether a particular person or knower
  knows something <i>a priori</i> or believes it true on the basis of <i>a
    priori</i> evidence." 
</quote>
He has abandoned, <i>ab inito</i> any attempt to make sense of the <i>a
  priori</i> as an objective classification of propositions.
So we might wonder what relevant the sequel to anyone whose interest is
confined to these concepts as classifications for propositions, and what is the
point in comparing these concepts with that of necessity.
</p>
<p>
Not content with failing to provide an account of <i>a priori</i> as a
classifier of propositions he then devotes one paragraph to arguing, in effect
that this cannot be done.
i.e. he rejects the idea that if something can be known <i>a priori</i> then it
cannot be known <i>a posteriori</i>.
</p>
<p>
In arguing the case his examples glide effortlessly between observations about
a priori <i>belief</i> and a priori <i>knowledge</i> in such a way as to make
me suspect that he considers the epistemic status of a knowledge to be the same
as the epistemic status of the belief.
</p>
<p>
He does not appear to consider the possibility that the <i>justification</i>
which may be thought necessary for the belief to be considered knowledge might have a role
to play in determining epistemic status.
</p>
<p>
By contast, I believe that for the concept of the <i>a priori</i> to work best
it should not be used at all as a qualifier of beliefs, and its use in relation
to knowledge should be to qualify the <i>justification</i> on the basis of which the
knowledge is supposed to have been established.
Finally, we might add, that a knowledge is only true knowledge if its supposed
justification is does in fact justify, and that this will only be the case if
it is appropriate to the subject matter of the proposition in question.
If the proposition makes a substantive claim about the world, then an <i>a
    posteriori</i> justification is needed, otherwise an <i>a priori</i>
justification is required.
Thus, for a belief to be knowledge, its justification <i>must</i> be
epistemically appropriate, and the kind of justification involved has little to
do with how anyone may have come to believe the proposition.
