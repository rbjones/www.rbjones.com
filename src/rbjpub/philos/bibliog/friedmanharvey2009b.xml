<maintitle align="center">Notes by RBJ on<br/>Concept Calculus: Much
  Better Than<br/>by Harvey Friedman</maintitle>

<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
Friedman, after forty years of concentration (though not exclusive) on
a program to make more conspicuous to mathematicians the importance of
mathematical logic in general and the implications of the G&ouml;del
incompleteness results, has unleashed himself to attempt some work
which he hopes (expects perhaps) will have a broader signficance.

A few words on the nature of my interest in this material.

<subsec title="In Common">
<p>
Friedman and I have one thing in common, which is a belief in the fundamental importance of the theory of well-founded sets.
We both belief that its signficance is not only in mathematical logic, nor even in mathematics, but also for philosophy and for many other disciplines.
</p><p>
I don't however see much in common in our conceptions of what the importance of set theory is.
</p><p>
I would describe Harvey's conception as being about what I would call "proof theoretic strength" perhaps better "consistency strength", but which Harvey might call "interpretive power", and I agree that this is one of the important things which is supplied uniquely well by set theory.
