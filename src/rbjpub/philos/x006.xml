<section title="Positivist Critiques of Metaphysics" tag="PCM">
<abstract>
Hume's fork supports a rejection of metaphysics, and reappears with similar
effect in the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap.
A critique of the resulting conventionalist position makes a space for a
kind of metaphysics.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Introduction">
The approach adopted here is to start from the positivist rejection of
metaphysics through Hume's fork and its later presentation in the philosophy of
Carnap.
This leads to a conventionalist position, in which apparently metaphysical
claims are presented as logical consequences of choices about language.
A critique of radical conventionalism then make space in the positivist
framework for a new kind of metaphysics.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Hume's Fork" dir="epistem" doc="xep004">
<p>
Hume's fork divides matters of objective truth into truths of reason and
matters of fact.
Hume says that only truths of reason are intuitively or demonstratively
certain, and that our conclusions about matters of fact are obtained by
non-rational and less reliable means.
Hume condemns metaphysics, by which he means any claim to objective truths
which do not comply with this classification both in the character of the
allegation and the method by which it is to be established.
</p><p>
Hume was inspired by Newton, and placed philosophy as concerned with matters of
fact, as an empirical (though not experimental) science of Human nature.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Metaphysics as Synthetic/A Priori">
The characterisation of metaphysics in terms of the analytic/synthetic
distinction is initiated by Kant in response to Hume, and becomes the dominant
simplistic conception of the issue between the Positivists and the Metaphysicians.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Hume's Phenomenalism">
<p>
Hume not only condemned those matters which might normally have been regarded
as metaphysical, but took a Platonic line on what we can know of the world of
the senses.
His conception of necessity was clearly one of logical necessity, and he first
argues that causal connections are not necessary.
On the further presumption that all our supposed knowledge of the external
world is based on the evidence of our senses, which is at best causally related
to the available (sensory) evidence, and the implicit demand that true
knowledge can only be had of things which follow necessarily from the evidence
he concludes that our knowledge of the external world is illusory, and our
tendency to belief is rooted in habitual disposition.
</p><p>
By systematic application of the demand, in effect for demonstrative proof,
Hume casts doubt on all knowledge except that of relations between ideas and of
sensory impressions.
Though he explains our beliefs as rooted in habit, he also effectively
re-interprets these beliefs by attempting to construe them in terms which do
not go beyond the available evidence.
</p><p>
This sets the pattern for a radical positivist conception of metaphysics as any
conclusion about the external world which goes beyond conclusions logically
entailed by the available evidence.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Going Beyond the Evidence">
<p>
Hume's phenomenalism presents his philosophy as a mitigated scepticism.
Hume grants a disposition to demonstrative knowledge, allowing by contrast with
previous empiricists that this category of <i>a priori</i> knowledge is
non-trivial and crucially includes mathematics.
</p><p>
However, the mitigation is confined to the <i>a priori</i>, in respect of
empirical knowledge a full-blooded pyrrhonism is applied, denying that we have
even probable knowledge of the external world.
</p><p>
This is characteristic of extreme positivism, in which scientists are expected
go further than the evidence strictly warrants, and in terms of which any such
speculation is regarded as metaphysical.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Metaphysics as Meaningless">
<p>
As positivists become more concerned with meaning, this provides an alternative
motivator for the identification and exclusion of metaphysics.
At first positivist conceptions of meaning are so closely coupled with the
relationship between a proposition and the evidence which would suffice to
verify it, that exclusion as meaningless is not clearly distinct from exclusion
as going beyond any possible evidence.
</p><p>
Later the coupling is weakened, and the requirement for claims or questions to
be meaningful becomes a more moderate demand than that of empirical verifiability.

<section title="The Evolution of Carnap's Positivism" tag="CT">
<abstract>
Carnap's logical positivism matured into a position a hairs breath from
embracing metaphysics.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Carnap's fork">
On the division of propositions Carnap's view is similar to Hume's though the
terminology has changed.
There is considerably greater detail.
The characterisation of the <i>a priori</i> as concerned with relations between
ideas (in Hume) becomes in the early Carnap, via ``semantic ascent'', their
characterisation as {\it about syntax} and in the later Carnap as tautological.  
<p>
In the later Carnap the notion of analyticity is made precise by a model of language
semantics as truth conditions, and matches precisely the concept of logical
necessity understood as truth in all possible worlds.
</p><p>
Carnap was inspired by Russell, (and influenced by Frege and Wittgenstein), and
held that philosophical propositions are analytic.
His attitude towards metaphysics was affected by his internal/external
distinction.
In these terms, the "fork" is a statement about "internal" questions,
i.e. questions put in some language with a well defined semantics.
Analyticity in such a language is determined by the semantics.
Questions about the legitimacy of the semantics are external questions, which Carnap
considered meaningless and believed should be settled pragmatically.
</p><p>
For some reason he does not seem to consider the external questions as having
meaning determined by the semantics of some meta-language.
This may be connected with his conception of the significance of G&ouml;del's
theorems.
G&ouml;del's techniques for the arithmetisation of syntax Carnap saw as showing
that one did not need a metalanguage distinct from the object language
(this at a time when he thought semantic notions could be give syntactic
definitions).
Though he later embraced semantics more enthusiastically, he does not ever seem
to have embraced formal meta-languages.
</p><p>
Carnap's position is {\it conventionalist} then in this respect.
Insofar as true supposedly metaphysical propositions are necessary they must in
his conceptual scheme also be analytic.
Their truth therefore derives from the conventions which were adopted in
defining the semantics of the language, and these are not themselves
propositions but definitions.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Starting from Russell">
<p>
Carnap may helpfully be thought of as progressing Russell's programme for
scientific philosophy, of which the most important elements are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The logical techniques exemplified in Principia Mathematica</li>
<li>The metaphysics of Logical Atomism</li>
<li>The idea that Philosophy itself should consist in some kind of logical analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>
Russell had two techniques which had been employed in Principia, which he
applied in his Logical Atomism and which he thought fundamental to the analytic
methods which he advocated.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The notion of "incomplete symbols"</li>
<li>The construction of "logical fictions"</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the former, certain apparently referential phrases are explained away by
syntactic devices which avoid the dependence on some object to be referred to.
(as in Russell's theory of descriptions, see [<bibref name="Russell05"/>]).
</p><p>
In the latter, Russell takes particulars alone as really existing.
Everthing else is treated as a "logical construction" from particulars
(e.g. classes of particulars).
These logical constructions are considered to be theoretically convenient fictions.
</p><p>
Russell is ambivalent about what particulars are.
As an empiricist he leans toward sense data as particulars.
The other possibility is that they are events, which I think Carnap would
describe as a physicalistic rather than a phenomenalistic ontology.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Carnap's Phenomenalism and Physicalism">
<p>
Carnap begin's positivistically with a phenomenalistic formalisation of physics
in his <i>Aufbau</i> [<bibref name="Carnap28"/>].
</p><p>
His subsequent migration through physicalistic to theoretical languages can be
seen as a progressive liberalisation of his positivistic anti-metaphysic,
admitting the existence of entities progressively further removed from the raw
data of experience.
</p><p>
He has not abandoned a desire to see these languages all connected tangibly
with their phenomenal evidential underpinning, but his pragmatism allows him to
admit the languages first and worry about the philosophical connections later.
</p><p>

This corresponds broadly with Russell's logical atomism, in which Russell
conceives of the world as populated
</p><p>
This aspect of anti-metaphysical positivism is stronger in the early than in
the later Carnap, where it is virtually extinguished by the ``principle of
tolerance''.
Carnap's was concerned with formalisation of the language of science, and he
began by attempting a phenomenalistic reduction consistent with a radical
nominalism.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>

</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Tolerance and External Questions">
<p>
When Carnap comes to articulate the rationale (for he has one) underpinning his
progressive liberalisation his initially rigorous positivism, the story he
comes up with amounts to a complete elimination of dogmatic nominalism from positivism.
</p><p>
Carnap went on to consider {\it physicalistic} language and {\it
theoretical} language.
His principle of tolerance effectively admits any metaphysic to be incorporated
into the semantics of a language.
Once incorporated into a language in this way, the ``internal'' metaphysical
questions become analytic, and the ``external'' questions (which relate to the
legitimacy of such a semantics) can be dealt with on a purely pragmatic basis.

<section title="Moderating Conventionalism" tag="SIC">
<abstract>
Why choices about language should not be completely arbitrary.
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="External Questions">
<p>
The most radical aspect of the later Carnap's conventionalism, insofar as it is
anti-metaphysical, probably lies in his attitude towards "external questions".
These he regards as meaningless, and considers that the acceptance or rejection
of a language should be done on a pragmatic basis without regard to the
external questions.
For present purposes the external questions may be considered to be ontological
questions about whether or not the things required to render the semantics of
the language actually exist.
</p><p>
To persuade Carnap to take these questions seriously, a two pronged assault
would probably be necessary.
</p><p>
Firstly, taking Carnap's pragmatism as a point on which to exert leverage, we
can ask how these pragmatic questions might be progressed.
Exhibiting ways in which one can provide convincing (not necessarily
conclusive) reasons for or against some choice, is one way to give credence to
the idea that the propositions at stake are not entirely meaningless.
</p><p>
Secondly, we may try to identify metaphysical choices which connect with
important considerations which seem on their face to be objective features of
reality rather rather than conventional distinctions rooted in language.
One such is the distinction between logical and empirically factual propositions.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol><sbcol>
<subsec title="A Neutral Stance">
<p>
To reject external questions as meaningless is a dogmatic posture, out of
character with the liberal attitudes of the mature Carnap.
</p><p>
Just as pure mathematics can be progressed without knowing whether it will ever
have applications, so one may engage in metaphysics without any certainty of
its applicability.
Observers may accept it on that basis at least, and reserve judgement in
default of convincing arguments as to whether it has any objective validity.
</p><p>
The investigation of questions of objective validity, or of other grounds for
adopting a metaphysic, can itself be seen as an
aspect of metaphysical research.

<section title="Metaphysics in Metaphysical Positivism" tag="mmp">
<abstract>
Some notes on the idea that Hume's fork as represented in the philosophy of
Rudolf Carnap is a pragmatic choice of language, underlying which is a
fundamental and objective distinction between two kinds of judgement or
proposition.
As such this central doctrine qualifies as a kind of positivistically sanitised metaphysics. 
</abstract>

<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Introduction">
The approach adopted here is to start from the positivist rejection of
metaphysics through Hume's fork and its later presentation in the philosophy of
Carnap.
This leads to a conventionalist position, in which apparently metaphysical
claims are presented as logical consequences of choices about language.
A critique of radical conventionalism then make space in the positivist
framework for a new kind of metaphysics.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Purpose">
It is my purpose here simply to identify some problems which seem to me to be of philosophical interest
That I can now exalt in such a purpose is symptomatic of the advance of my own personal scepticism.
Previously I have sought to articulate some elementary philosophical principles as a prelude to the articulation of ideas which belong properly to <i>engineering</i> rather than philosophy.
The perceived need for such an articulation lead swifly to an acute and debilitating awareness that these principles which seemed to me elementary, were regarded by many or most contemporary philosophers as false.
<p />
A significant element of the position here considered is Popper stance in the poker debate.
By this I mean the philosophical issue at stake between Popper and Wittgenstein on the occasion of Popper's speaking at the Moral Sciences Club in Cambridge.
The invitation to Popper invited him to speak upon some "Philosophical Riddle" and Popper chose to attach the presumption apparent in this form of invitation that philosophy is not concerned with substantive problems.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Structure">
The <i>philosophical position</i> which I occupy, seems to me, rather than a collection of substantive disagreements on matters of (philosophical) fact, is accounted for primarily by a divergent philosophical interests and related idiomatic preferences.
My disagreement with other philosophers on the truth of various statements is often the child of conflicting usage.
<p />
Because of this a bald statement of position has sometimes seemed to me more appropriate than a confrontation on points of controversy.
<p />
As I have become more aware of my own limitations in progressing the kinds of philosophical problem which I find most interesting, the mere formulation of problems has come to seem by itself worthwhile and interesting.
The focus simply on the statement of problems reinforces my perception that my position consists in large parts of interests, languages and methods rather than of doctrine.
The structure of this work is therefore oriented toward making explicit the extent to which my philosophical world view consists in choice of language and methods appropriate for certain problems of interest.
<p />
The first part of the work is simply a position statement, but its role is auxiliary.
The next part attempts to recast as much as possible of that position as mere choice of language, appropriate for the formulation of the oroblems which appears in the final part.

</sbcol>
</secbody>

<secbody title="The Neutral Metaphysic">
<sbcol>
<subsec>
Positive metaphysics consists in a neutral method for metaphysical research,
allowing the analysis of alternative metaphysical systems on their merits,
with a minimalistic metaphysic underlying the analytic method.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Neutral Method">
<p>
The proposed neutral method is the method of logical analysis, involving
formal abstract modelling.
This is done in a context in which a rich ontology of abstracts are available
to model proposed metaphysical systems, without prejuduce, insofar as the
model of a particular metaphysical system may make use of only a small part of
the available ontology.
</p><p>
A single logical foundation, supported by appropriate computer software is
advocated.
This is intended to prejudice the modelling of metaphysical systems as little
as possible.
Some analysis will be undertaken of what the residual prejudice in the system is.
</p><p>
This should be thought of as providing the kind of relatively neutral context
in which to conduct research as set theory provides for Mathematics.
</p><p>
It is true that many objections to set theory have been raised by
philosophers and philosophically minded mathematicians, but it seems to be the
case that most practicing mathematicians conduct their research without needing
to pay much attention to the foundations of their subject.
When investigating a new area of mathematics, mathematicians do not need to ask
the question "what logical system should we use for this kind of mathematics?",
they can and do take logic and set theory for granted, and rarely find
themselves in areas where foundational issues are signficant.
</p><p>
Our neutral foundation is in effect set theory, messed about with for purely
pragmatic reasons.
This alignment with mathematics makes for a purely logical version of the
positivistic theses of the "Unity of Science", in which, for deductive and
nomologico-deductive sciences a single logical foundation is advocated.
However, it is not supposed that all science can yield models suitable for
deductive reasoning.
