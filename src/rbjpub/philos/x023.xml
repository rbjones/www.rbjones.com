<section title="Introduction">
<abstract>
In this introduction is given a first sketch of the system which will be expanded in the subsequent sections.

<subsec title="">
Metaphysical positivism is a system of analytic philosophy in which the analysis in question is logical in the sense of modern symbolic logic.
All hangs around an articulation of method which is to be done as far as possible according to that method.
This articulation of method is foundational in character, and hence ultimately circular.
</subsec>
<subsec title="The Method of Logical Analysis">
<p>
The method is:
<ul>
<li>in a suitable context, construct an abstract conceptual model of the problem domain,</li>
<li>then reason about the problem domain deductively using the abstract model as a proxy.</li>
</ul>
This method is proposed for analysis (or synthesis) in any domain in which deductive reasoning may be possible.
Deductive reasoning will be possible whenever a relevant model can be obtained by the methods proposed.
</p><p>
Metaphysical positivism is then concerned with philosophically profound and problematic applications of the method, e.g. to metaphysics.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Prerequisites">
Articulation of the method involved addressing some of the most fundamental problems of philosophy.
At the core of this is a general account of semantics, and an approach to dealing with the problem of semantic regress (the idea that a definition of semantics must be done in a metalanguage stronger than the object language, which in turn could only have its semantics defined in a yet stronger meta-meta-language and so on ad infinitum).
</subsec>
<subsec title="Applications">
The first non-philosophical application is to science and engineering in which case it is a realisation of the "nomologico-deductive method" in which the laws of physics are formulated using the abstract model and conclusions about the world (presuming the truth of the relevant laws) are obtained by deductive reasoning using that model. 
</subsec>
</sbcol>
</secbody>

<secbody title="Metaphysics and Positivism">
<sbcol>
<subsec >
<p>
Possibly the most characteristic doctrine of positivist thought is its outright rejection of "Metaphysics".
Nevertheless, a broad conception of positivism may embrace varieties of pragmatism, some of which have been more conciliatory toward metaphysics.
</p><p>
Metaphysical positivism respects Aristotle's conception of metaphysics (first philosophy) as locating the high ground of philosophical thought, at the same time as recognising the great difficulty in making metaphysical problems sufficiently definite to have answers.
The core doctrines of metaphysical positivism are not themselves metaphysical, but philosophically it is perhaps their ultimate purpose to pave the way, to provide an appropriate conceptual and methodological framework, for an approach to metaphysics.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<p>
In metaphysical positivism the positivistic desire to avoid nonesense and incoherence, which is typically focussed by positivists, remains important.
Metaphysics is however not always considered pathological, and is no longer considered the primary source of pathology in recent philosophical thought.
</p><p>
Instead of talking of the demarcation between science and metaphysics, taking this to be that between empirically meaningful and meaningless metaphysical positivism proposes a linguistic and methodological framework for nomologico-deductive science considered as construction of abstract models of aspects of concrete reality.
These methods provide ways of making the construction and deductive application of abstract models ultimately precise.
The emphasis is on enabling coherent and precise discourse rather than on condemning vagueness and incoherence,

<secbody title="A Priori Method">
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<p>
Before it is possible to reason soundly (or deductively, which is the same thing) it is first necessary to establish a language with a well-defined semantics,
"Soundness" is of course a semantic concept, in default of a semantics the notion of semantics is without meaning.
In order to make the concepts in some domain precise, it is first necessary to establish consider what these concepts are about.
Making language precise therefore consists in constructing an abstract model of the intended subject matter and then defining the relevant concepts in terms of that abstract model.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<p>
Once a language has been established it becomes possible to explore the subject domain, developing an intuitive understanding which is progressively confirmed by deductive demonstration of its conjectures.
</p><p>
Applications of the theory developed in this way involve connecting the abstract model with some concrete application domain.

<subsec title="Introduction">
<p>
Metaphysical positivism is concerned with <i>a priori</i> methods both in philosophy and in other domains where these methods are applicable, i.e. in all domains in which deductive reasoning may be beneficial.
</p><p>
Here is a first sketch of terminology and method.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Objective">
The aim is to contribute to our understanding of various problems by <i>a priori</i> analysis.
Furthermore, we aim always to achieve high standards of rigour, and therefore seek to establish results deductively.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Deductive Reasoning">
We <i>define</i> deductive reasoning as <i>reasoning conducted exclusively</i> using <i>sound</i> inference rules, for this purpose treating axioms as rules with no premises.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Logical Truth">
Results which are obtainable by deduction from the empty set of premises are called <i>logical truths</i>.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Soundness">
An inference rule is sound if it when applied to true premises always yields true conclusions.
Truth, which is a <i>semantic</i> notion, is therefore crucial.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Semantics">
For the purpose of judging whether or ensuring that our rules of inference are sound it is desirable that the languages in use have well-defined semantics.
A <i>truth conditional</i> semantics suffices for this purpose. 
</subsec>
<subsec title="Analyticity">
It follows from our definition of logical truth that the logical truth is the same thing as analyticity.

<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Deductive Philosophy">
<p>
First note that though metaphysical positivism is philosophy based on logic, it does not purport to encompass the whole of philosophy.
It is concerned with that part of philosophy for which the methods of symbolic logic are appropriate, which happens also to be that part of philosophy to which deductive reasoning is applicable, which is in turn, that part in which the problems can be given a definite meaning, or can usefully be approached through formal models.
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Russell">
<p>
Here it is appropriate to aknowledge Bertrand Russell, who not only contributed to the transformation of mathematics effected by modern logic, but also proposed that philosophy should become an <i>a priori</i> science entirely based on the new conception of logic,
Though Russell is better described as an empiricist than as a positivist, the example he set by his work on <i>Principia Mathematica</i> and his ideas about the transformation of philosophy into a scientific discpline were an inspiration to the logical positivist Rudolf Carnap, whose philosophy is the most recent ancestor of metaphysical positivism.
</p><p>
Russell was not the first philosopher to aknowledge the importance of logic to philosophy.
His importance in this context is that he understood the advances in modern symbolic logic as making possible a rigour in philosophy which logic had hitherto been too weak to deliver.

<section title="The Analytic/Synthetic Dichotomy" tag="ASD">
<abstract>
</abstract>
<secbody>
<sbcol>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="The Analytic Synthetic Dichotomy">
The notion of sound deduction is intimately coupled with an appropriate conception of analyticity
The analytic/synthetic dichotomy is therefore the starting point for metaphysical positivism, which would wholly collapse without it.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Hume">
<p>
Though the terms "analytic" and "synthetic" in the relevant senses were not current in Hume's time, Hume was the first philosopher to have a clear conception of this distinction, which he described as the distinction between "relations between ideas" and "matters of fact".
It is clear also that he considered this to be the same distinction as that between necessary and contingent propositions.
This and two other related ideas of Hume are also core doctrines of metaphysical positivism.
The first is that evaluative statements form a class of claims distinct from analytic and synthetic judgements, and the second that some judgements fail to fall into any of these categories and are pathological in some important way.
</p><p>
Metaphysical Positivism is conducted in a conceptual franework in which this four-fold classification of indicative statements is fundamental (analytic/synthetic/evaluative/meaningless),
It is not claimed that these concepts as used in metaphysical positivism are exactly the same as any prior usage.
It is not claimed, for example, that moral judgements are not cognitive, it is rather proposed that moral language should be used in such a way that they are not.
The term metaphysics by contrast with Hume's usage and the general positivist tradition, is not used for certain meaningless propositions.
It is recognised that philosophical language often is insufficiently clear in its meaning to provide a sound basis for deductive reasoning, but the dominent forms of philosophical nonsense change from one historical period to the next.
