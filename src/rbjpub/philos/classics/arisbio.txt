Aristotle was born in 384 B.C. in the town of Stagira in Macedonia
(now called Stavros).
At the age of 17 he entered Plato's Academy in Athens, where he
remained until Plato's death nineteen years later.
During this time he first thoroughly absorbed the ideas of Plato and
then began to move apart on his own philosophical path.
On the death of Plato Aristotle spent some time away from Athen's
including a period when he acted as tutor to prince Alexander, later
to be Alexander the Great, returning to Athens at about 50 years in
age to begin his most fruitful period as a philosopher.

Close to Athen's Aristotle founded his own school, the Lyceum, and
began the first of the great libraries.
Here Aristotle remained until the death of Alexander in 323 B.C. after
which a rise in anti-Macedonian feeling obliged him to leave.
He died in 322 B.C.

The surviving works of Aristotle date from this last period at the
Lyceum, and were the academic textbooks of the time.
Substantial, original, and broadly scoped, they were to dominate the
intellectual history of Western Europe for over a thousand years, and
remain of the greatest importance to this day.
