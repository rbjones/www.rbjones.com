<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
<i>Metaphysical Positivism</i> is systematic constructive positivist philosophy.
We present here sketches of <i>Metaphysical Positivism</i> together with some related historical material which might possibly help the reader come to an understanding of this system and its place in the history of ideas.

<section title="The Book">
<abstract>
I am at present working towards a book intended for publication as a POD
paperback provisionally entitled "Metaphysical Positivism".
<p/>
Though I have definite ideas about what I want to do in the book,
I am hoping to involve others in its creation through philosophical discussion and debate.
<p/>
This section provide access to drafts of the book in various forms and to
other related materials.

<subsec title="Presentations of The Book">
<p>
Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
book.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format
you find most convenient.
All except the paperback book format are provided for you to read or download
for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the book, with the sole exception of the paperback format, which will become
available only when the book is deemed complete (-enough for the first edition).
</p><p>
The available formats are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="../www/books/ftd/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="../www/books/ftd/ftdpam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>
</ul>
A link for buying the paperback from Amazon will be included when the book has
been published.

<subsec title="Other Materials">
I have a variety of other material on this topic which I am developing
concurrently with the book.
Some of these provide additional detail and discussion or background, others
present the material in different ways.

<subsec title="Scope of The Book">
Though entitled "Metaphysical Positivism", <i>the book</i> as at present conceived, is
not as broad as the conception of metaphysical positivism (incompletely) presented on the
RBJones.com web site.
The book project began as a monograph project specifically on "Hume's Fork" and
it was in trying to provide sufficient context for a proper understanding of
the significance of Hume's fork that I was lead into making "Metaphysical
Positivism" the headline.
Nevertheless, Hume's fork, with its apparent principle function of eliminating
metaphysics, is central to the account, and presented as the central feature of
positivist philosophy, and it is from an examination of what has happened
in the history of controversy over the fork that we come to understand in what
sense metaphysics is thereby eliminated, and in what sense there remains a
place for metaphysics on the high ground of philosophical enquiry.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Discussions">
I had hopes of vigorous discussion of the work in progress and my preferred
venue for this was the hist-analytic mailing list
(see <xlink href="http://rbjones.com/pipermail/hist-analytic_rbjones.com/">archives</xlink>).
I am now rather more pessimistic about the prospects for much worthwhile
discussion, but still happy to engage.
To subscribe to hist-analytic see <xlink href="http://hist-analytic.org/">hist-analytic.org</xlink>.
I am also willing to engage in private discussion, for which purpose I (rbj) may be
emailed at rbjones.com.
If you want to engage in some other forum, post your contribution to the forum and copy me.
I will then respond in the relevant forum, if appropriate.

<section title="Positivism as Metaphysics" tag="pam">
<abstract>
Some notes on the idea that Hume's fork as represented in the philosophy of
Rudolf Carnap is a pragmatic choice of language, underlying which is a
fundamental and objective distinction between two kinds of judgement or
proposition.
As such this central doctrine qualifies as a kind of positivistically sanitised metaphysics. 
</abstract>

<secbody>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Introduction">
The approach adopted here is to start from the positivist rejection of
metaphysics through Hume's fork and its later presentation in the philosophy of
Carnap.
This leads to a conventionalist position, in which apparently metaphysical
claims are presented as logical consequences of choices about language.
A critique of radical conventionalism then make space in the positivist
framework for a new kind of metaphysics.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Purpose">
It is my purpose here simply to identify some problems which seem to me to be of philosophical interest
That I can now exalt in such a purpose is symptomatic of the advance of my own personal scepticism.
Previously I have sought to articulate some elementary philosophical principles as a prelude to the articulation of ideas which belong properly to <i>engineering</i> rather than philosophy.
The perceived need for such an articulation lead swifly to an acute and debilitating awareness that these principles which seemed to me elementary, were regarded by many or most contemporary philosophers as false.
<p />
A significant element of the position here considered is Popper stance in the poker debate.
By this I mean the philosophical issue at stake between Popper and Wittgenstein on the occasion of Popper's speaking at the Moral Sciences Club in Cambridge.
The invitation to Popper invited him to speak upon some "Philosophical Riddle" and Popper chose to attach the presumption apparent in this form of invitation that philosophy is not concerned with substantive problems.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Structure">
The <i>philosophical position</i> which I occupy, seems to me, rather than a collection of substantive disagreements on matters of (philosophical) fact, is accounted for primarily by a divergent philosophical interests and related idiomatic preferences.
My disagreement with other philosophers on the truth of various statements is often the child of conflicting usage.
<p />
Because of this a bald statement of position has sometimes seemed to me more appropriate than a confrontation on points of controversy.
<p />
As I have become more aware of my own limitations in progressing the kinds of philosophical problem which I find most interesting, the mere formulation of problems has come to seem by itself worthwhile and interesting.
The focus simply on the statement of problems reinforces my perception that my position consists in large parts of interests, languages and methods rather than of doctrine.
The structure of this work is therefore oriented toward making explicit the extent to which my philosophical world view consists in choice of language and methods appropriate for certain problems of interest.
<p />
The first part of the work is simply a position statement, but its role is auxiliary.
The next part attempts to recast as much as possible of that position as mere choice of language, appropriate for the formulation of the oroblems which appears in the final part.
