<subsec title="First Thoughts">
<p>
When I first thought it might be a good idea to say something about critical
rationalism here, that first throught was to produce a comparison with
Metaphysical Positivism, my own philosophical position.
</p><p>
My second thought was that I don't really know enough about critical
rationalism to do a meaningful comparison.
But that I might instead offer a few words on why I am not myself a critical
rationalist, which reasons I could not truthfully represent as based on other
than a superficial knowledge of critical rationalism.
</p><p>
Even this much, however, could not be done without a bit of digging into how
critical rationalism is now presented, and my first impressions reading David
Miller make me wonder whether it might be worth my while taking it a bit more seriously.
</p><p>
So, I have not yet made my mind up which of the two approaches to take.
Perhaps both in turn!

<subsec title="Second Thoughts">
<p>
I have for a long time thought that I should read a recent account of
"Critical Rationalism", thinking mostly of Miller's defence.
I almost bought it today, but I was distacted by a minor issue, that
Amazon no longer themselves stock the book.
There are plenty of copies available from the amazon marketplace, to
this should not really have distracted me, but in checking the
marketplace prices with prices elsewhere I came across an article on
Critical Rationalism in Sorites by Armando Cintero.
This is a discussion of the defence by Miller of Bartley's
"pan-critical rationalism".
</p><p>
I did read some material by Bartley on his pancritical rationalism a
while back, but somehow I lost it and have not been able to discover
it recently.
It struck me as \emph{rationalistic} in various ways which I
deprecate.
</p><p>
That is, in the sense that it involves fielding "rational" arguments
for or against propositions which are not logical (or analytic).
This would not be quite so bad if it weren't that both critical
rationalism and (I am guessing pancritical rationalism) are also
labelled "deductivism" because they accept deductive but not inductive
reasoning.
</p><p>
The material therefore seemed to show a lack of awareness of the
limits of deduction, which for me was by itself a reason not to
seriously consider critical rationalism or its neighbours as a serious
philosophical system.
</p><p>
Though I still can't locate the Bartley material, I have an account of
this kind of reasoning, to work from, which allows me to describe why
I am not a critical or pancritical rationalist.

<subsec title="The Open Society">
My familiarity with Popper's writings is mainly confined to his volumes on the
Open Society.
I enjoyed these enormously, and am pretty enthusiastic about the idea of an
Open Society.
My own ideas in this area are not well worked out, but there are definite
points of disagreement, for example in relation to utopian thinking.
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="The Problem of Induction">
I agree with Popper in not thinking much of the idea of "inductive inference".
However, I don't much care for Popper's alternative.
I am inclined to consider empirical (but not deductive) science as hypothetical
in perpetuity.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Deductivism">
<p>
This seems to be used by some as an alternative to Critical Rationalism, naming
Popper's philosophy.
</p><p>
The first name I chose for my own conception of analytic philosophy was
"philosophical logicism" and this could be described as a kind of deductivism.
However, it bears little resemblance to Critical Rationalism.
