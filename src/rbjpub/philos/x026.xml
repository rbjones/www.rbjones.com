<abstract>
Positivism is traditionally both anti-dogmatic and dogmatic, in this similar to
scepticism.
In "liberal" positivism, we seek to capture the positive elements of positivism

<subsec title="phenomenalism">
There is no real difference between 'essence' and 'phenomenon'.
</subsec>
<subsec title="nominalism">
"every abstract science is a method of abbreviating the recording of experiences and gives us no extra, independent knowledge in the sense that, via its abstractions, it opens access to empirically inaccessible domains of reality"
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="the denial that value judgements and normative statements can be knowledge">
An example of this is Hume's denial that one can derive an "ought" from an "is".
</subsec>
<subsec title="the unity of science">
A belief in the essential unity of scientific method.
Exactly in what that unity consists seems a bit variable.
