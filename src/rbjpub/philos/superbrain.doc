\chapter{Proposal}

The proposed work is a monograph of uncertain length.

The character of the work will be philosophical, broadly within the tradition which has recently been known as {\it analytic} philosophy, but which arguably extends back to Socrates and beyond.

There will be a single overarching subject matter through which some of the fundamental problems of analytic philosophy will be motivated.
That subject is the relationship between people and machines as machines become ever more capable of undertaking intellectual as well as physical tasks, and as global networking facilitates collaboration between peopla and information processing machinery.
Among the questions considered are questions of trust and of authority in this context.

In this matter the distinction between analytic and other propositions is particularly significant, and is reflected in the structure of the work.

A provisional title for the work is {\it SuperBrain}.
It will consist of one introductory chapter followed by two parts, {\it The Analytic SuperBrain} and {\it The Holistic Superbrain}.

The introductory chapter will have the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Background}
\item{The Problem}
\item{The Method}
\item{The Analytic}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Proposal 1}

This chapter is not intended to be a part of the book.

The book is intended to be a bit like a hybrid between ``Language Truth and Logic'' and ``Engines of Creation'', i.e. a hybrid between a book of analytic philosophy aimed for a broad audience and a work of technological imagination bordering on science fiction.

The technological element which provides an overarching purpose for the book is the architectural design of an intelligent artefact.
The enterprise is therefore thought of (by its author) as descended from the {\it Calculus Ratiocinator} of Leibniz and from his interest in the construction of calculating machines.
The architecture proposed is lightly sketched, the main substance of the book being devoted to the rationale, which turns out to be largely philosophical.

Central to the architecture is the delineation of a domain of knowledge in which suitably engineered artefacts can be trusted to speak with authority.
This is the realm of the analytic.
The centrality of this concept is reflected in the structuring of the book into two parts, concerned with {\it analytic} and {\it holistic} intelligence.

The engineering of intelligence provides subject matters for deliberations which are primarily philosophical, and analytic, but which differ quite significantly both in subject and method from contemporary analytic philosophy.
Its therefore desirable to make clear at the outset what kind of philosophical analysis is involved.
\footnote{Not sure whether this material should appear in Part I or in some prior chapters.}

Here are the main characteristics of the kind of philosophical analysis proposed.

Firstly, it is proposed to take considerable pains to present all aspects of the analysis in as clear and intelligible a manner as can be contrived.
It is not therefore to be expected that the book will contain that kind of wisdom which may only be found in obscurity, in this our inspiration is Bertrand Russell.

Secondly, we note that among early analytic philosophers Frege, Russell and Carnap all took the view that for scientific purposes natural languages are deficient, and that formal notations should be devised and deployed which are more suitable for scientific use.
In this book, formal notations will not be directly used, though some of the concepts used can be presented here with precision only because they have benefitted from prior formal analysis.
Though the notation will not be formal, the key concepts will be {\it defined}, as technical terms, and used only in the specific sense in which they have been defined here.
We are therefore not concerned, in this work, with the meaning of these key concepts as they are found in natural English, or even with their prior usage as technical terms in philosophy or elsewhere, unless that prior usage is explicitly invoked.

Bertrand Russell participated in a revolution in logic which contributed to a transformation of the methods of mathematicians in the twentieth century.
He did not himself believe that these methods were relevant only to mathematics, but thought that philosophy could be transformed into a scientific discipline if it adopted the new methods of logic.
In this respect also we propose to follow Russell's advice, by adopting methods for the conduct of our philosophical analysis which are more commonly associated with mathematics than with philosophy.

\chapter{Introduction}

In this introduction I want to give a first explanation of the project in hand, and the methods to be used.
To do that, I think I need to give a little background.

The project in hand concerns {\it AI}, Artificial Intelligence.
It involves architectural design for a globally distributed intelligence, the components of which include both people and engineered artefacts (computers and networks).
If you think about the design of intelligent artefacts at a sufficiently high level, in a sufficiently systematic way, it is hard to avoid addressing and taking a position on some philosophical problems.
If you are unlucky you may find, as I have, that the most natural explanations of sound engineering principles can only be given in the teeth of opposing conventional wisdom from contemporary professional philosophers.
If you are a philosophically minded engineer, these philosophical problems may assume a greater interest than the more worldly aspects of the enterprise, and architectural design may become a thought experiment around which a philosophical enterprise is built.
This is what has happened to me.
This work has resulted. 

In my thinking about intelligence I have been interested primarily in problems which can be precisely formulated, and which have (if any) definite solutions which can be reliably checked.
Most mathematical problems have these characteristics, which carry forward to suitably well formulated applications of mathematics.
Many problems of engineering design are reducible to crisp problems using mathematical models of the problem domain, and so we can think of the target domain as encompassing design automation. 

There is a particular reason for separating out these crisp problems and for considering their automation in a different way to the way we consider the automation of less crisp AI problems, like natural language processing and many other aspects of the problem of building artefacts which emulate, simulate or replicate human behaviour.
That reason is trust.

In the literature of science fiction the spectre of an artificial intelligence running amok recurrs.
There are long standing principles, introduced by Asimov, guiding the design of Robots, which are intended to ensure their proper behaviour.
But other parts of the literature recognise that artificial intelligence, just like todays viruses and worms, may not observe any benign laws.
They may be designed with malicious intent, they may simply emerged or evolved from processes unknown to us and beyond out control, or they be the product of benign incompetence.
{\it The Singularity} to chose one name for such inhuman intelligence, is generally expected to be quite beyond our control.

\section{Method}

This work is intended primarily as {\it analytic philosophy}.
In this section I will describe some aspects of the kind of philosophical analysis to be employed.

\begin{itemize}

\item Attitude towards natural/ordinary language
\item Methods from mathematics.

\end{itemize}
