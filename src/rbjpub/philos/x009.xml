<subsec title="First Philosophy">
First let me refer back to the metaphysics of Aristotle, which he called "First Philosophy".
Some say that the term "metaphysics" owes its origin to the fact that the volume of Aristotle'w works in which "First Philosophy" appears after the volume on Physics, "meta" being derived from the Greek "&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;", one meaning of which is simply "after".
Today the prefix "meta" is frequently used to mean "above" or "beyond" and this gets us slightly closer to a semantic charactisation of metaphysics.
However, for its use in <i>metphysical positivism</i> it is best to think of it as connoting "before" (prerequisites) or "beneath" (foundations) [of physics], which sense is in reasonably harmony with that of Artisstotle's First Philosophy.

<subsec title="Nomologico-deductive Method">
<p>
Before considering what might be prior to physics it may be worth mentioning a specific conception of physics.
The nomologico-deductive method consists in the formulation of general laws from which particular observations or predictions are obtained by deduction.
</p><p>
This approach brings with it the possibility of elimination of certain possibilities by deduction from particular observations to the negation of general rules.
A classic example of this is the derivation from observations about the behaviour of light or of clocks the the refutation of Newton's conception of space-time.
