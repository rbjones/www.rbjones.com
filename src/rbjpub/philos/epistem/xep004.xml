When David Hume's <i>Treatise on Human Nature</i> "fell dead from the press",
he concluded that his exposition was at fault and set about writing a shorter
and more accessible account of the most important parts of his philosophy.
In <i><xlink href="../classics/hume/index.htm">An Enquiry Concerning Human
      Understanding</xlink></i>, Hume's own distillation of what mattered most
in his philosophy, at the very epicenter
(<xlink href="../classics/hume/echu041.htm">Section IV Part I</xlink>) we find the following oft quoted passage:

<subsec>
<blockquote>
<p>
"ALL the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures. That three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses a relation between these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence.
</p>
</blockquote>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Objects of Enquiry">
Hume's fork is concerned with a single classification of the "objects of
enquiry".
He does not here tell us what <i>kind</i> of thing an "object of enquiry" might
be.but it sounds like the kinds of thing of which we might have knowledge, so
judgements or propositions are contenders, or possibly sentences in context or
statements.
To further refine Hume's fork we will need to look more closely at this question.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Relations of Ideas">
This might be taken psychologically, an idea might be the same kind of thing as
a thought, or it might be some kind of thing which could be entertained in a
thought but which is not itself psychological.
The examples cited by Hume make it clear that he intends the latter.
In fact he here cites entire branches of mathematics as examples of objects of
human reason which concern relations of ideas.
He gives no other specific examples but then provides a second characterisation
of this class of "objects of reason", viz. "every affirmation which is either
intuitively or demonstratively certain".
So we now know that these objects are "affirmations".
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec>
<blockquote>
<p>
Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise to-morrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind."
