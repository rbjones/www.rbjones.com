<section title="Introduction" tag="intro">
<abstract>
The evolution of the analytic/synthetic distinction, over a period of more than
2000 years, provides an example of how progress in philosophy takes place and
of how that progress might be thought to contribute to progress for humanity.
<p />
This is one perspective on the story.

<blockquote>
I am preparing a short monograph on this topic intended for publication as a POD paperback.
<br/>
Though I have definite ideas about what I want to do in the monograph,
<br/>
I am hoping to involve others in its creation through philosophical discussion and debate.
<br/>
These pages provide access to drafts of the monograph in various forms and to
other related materials.

<subsec title="Presentations of The Monograph">
<p>
Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
monograph.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format

for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the monograph, with the sole exception of the paperback format, which will become
available only when the monograph is deemed complete (-enough for the first edition).
</p><p>
The available formats are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="../../www/books/ftd/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="../../www/books/ftd/ftdpam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>

<subsec title="Other Materials">
I have a variety of other material on this topic which I am developing
concurrently with the monograph.
Some of these provide additional detail and discussion or background, others
present the material in different ways.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Discussions">
I will be discussing the monograph with all comers on the hist-analytic mailing
list
(see <xlink href="http://rbjones.com/pipermail/hist-analytic_rbjones.com/">archives</xlink>)

<subsec title="Progress in Philosophy">
<p>
Is there progress in philosophy?
</p>
<p>
The story leading to Hume's fork can be presented as a tale of real advancement
in philosophy.
All the insights in that have now come to be questioned, and with those
questions the reality of that advancement must be questioned.
</p><p>
Is there progress?
</p>
</subsec>
<subsec title="Dogmatism and Scepticism">
<p>
Western Philosophy begins in dogmatic speculation, reaches its apogee in the
dogmatic systems of Plato and Aristotle, falls into scepticism and then
declines with the collapse of the Greek empire.
</p><p>
The creative intellectual freedom of ancient Greece is then replaced by an
extended period in which religious authority limits the advancement of
philosophy.
