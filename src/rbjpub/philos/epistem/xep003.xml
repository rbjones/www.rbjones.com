<section title="Introduction" tag="intro">
<abstract>
The evolution of the analytic/synthetic distinction, over a period of more than
2000 years, provides an example of how progress in philosophy takes place and
of how that progress might be thought to contribute to progress for humanity.
<p />
This is one perspective on the story.

<blockquote>
I am preparing a short monograph on this topic intended for publication as a POD paperback.
<br/>
Though I have definite ideas about what I want to do in the monograph,
<br/>
I am hoping to involve others in its creation through philosophical discussion and debate.
<br/>
These pages provide access to drafts of the monograph in various forms and to
other related materials.

<subsec title="Presentations of The Monograph">
<p>
Several different formats of document are generated from the sources of the
monograph.
These different forms have the same content so you may read whichever format
you find most convenient.
All except the paperback book format are provided for you to read or download
for reading from this web site at no cost, and you are granted permission only
to read them, not to make any other use of them.
All formats will be available for drafts from the earliest stages of writing
the monograph, with the sole exception of the paperpack format, which will become
available only when the monograph is deemed complete (-enough for the first edition).
</p><p>
The available formats are:
<ul>
<li><xlink href="../../www/books/ftd/index.htm">HTML</xlink> (produced by LaTeX2HTML)</li>
<li><xlink href="../../www/books/ftd/ftdpam.pdf">A4 PDF</xlink> two-column pamphlet</li>
</ul>
A link for buying the paperback from amazon will be included when the monograph has
been published.

<sbcol>
<subsec title="Other Materials">
I have a variety of other material on this topic which I am developing
concurrently with the monograph.
Some of these provide additional detail and discussion or background, others
present the material in different ways.
</subsec>
<subsec title="Discussions">
I will be discussing the monograph with all comers on the hist-analytic mailing
list
(see <xlink href="http://rbjones.com/pipermail/hist-analytic_rbjones.com/">archives</xlink>)
througout the writing, from the very earliest stages.
To subscribe see <xlink href="http://hist-analytic.org/">hist-analytic.org</xlink>.

<subsec title="Progress in Philosophy">
Philosophy is reknown, often contrasted with mathematics, for the inconstancy
of its dogmas, for having sustained almost every conceivable opinion and many
beyond belief.
