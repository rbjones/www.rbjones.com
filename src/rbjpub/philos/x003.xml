<section title="Overview">
<abstract>
Analytic Positivism is described by comparison with Logical Positivism, with particular reference to the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap.
In this we follow Carnap's own account of his philosophy as given in the Carnap volume of the library of liviving philosophers, using his own headings.

<p>
Logical positivism divides indicative sentences into three kinds.
Analytic sentences, which are supposed to be demonstrable, empirical facts, which must be verifiable, and the rest, which are nonesense.
Metaphysics is singled out for obloquy, where metaphysics is construed as a priori claims about the nature of reality (or the synthetic a priori).
</p><p>
In Carnap's philosophy through its various stages there are several different attitudes toward metaphysics.
In his earlier years he simply regarded metaphysics as <i>useless</i>, in the early years of logical positivism he regarded metaphysics as <i>meaningless</i>, adopting the verificationist view that the meaning of a proposition is its method of verification.
Later he adopted a more liberal view on meaning, and expressed the status of metaphysics as <i>lacking cognitive content</i>.

<subsec title="Analytic Positivism">
<p>
While recognising the same three categories of indicative sentence, the distinction between sense and nonesense is made by different means.
Sufficient meaning to support reasoning in a language may be provided by an <i>abstract semantics</i> (for the language under consideration), which will support the demonstration of analytic truths (though formal derivability is likely to be incomplete).
Concrete semantics presents greater difficulties, and for science a (nomologico-deductive) <i>modelling</i> methodology is advocated, in which considerations of <i>truth</i> are supplanted by those of utility.
</p>
<p>
Metaphysics has no special status in this scheme, though in the terminology of analytic positivism there are no synthetic a priori truths.
