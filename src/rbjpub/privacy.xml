<p>
I have not spent much time on this, and I am not hot on privacy.
</p><p>
The privacy policy of this site is simply to obtain no private information.
No use is made by the site of cookies, or any other means of gathering information about customers.
</p><p>
I did have search buttons to allow searches through Google, but it now appears that I have to
start asking permission for use of cookies even if I only link to Google, so I have removed them.
