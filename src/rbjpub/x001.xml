Below you will see accounts of what I am trying to do.
If you want to see what I actually am doing, the best place to look is in <xlink href="pp/doc/index.html">THE SHED</xlink>.

This is work in progress, expect it to be indiscipherable and misguided.

This is a project for the future.
It is "practical philosophy", i.e. is concerned with ethics, values, politics and economics.
Also a "philosophy of life".
It is built around <i>something like</i> Dao.
