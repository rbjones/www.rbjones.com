    This website was home to my work for about 20 years from about 1995.
    During that time, and for decades before that, my enterprise remained essentially the same, while my attempts to effect it morphed continually.
    </p><p>
    This is at once a <i>philosophical</i> and an <i>engineering</i> enterprise, the most tangible recent fruit being my attempts at the work "Positive Philosophy and the Automation of Reason" conceived of as a work of positive philosophy and an architectural plan and rationale for deductive synthetic cognition, but long since becalmed.
    </p><p>
    Most recently I decided to make the philosophy even more minimal and more constructive, by turning the whole thing into software development projects.
    These fledgling projects are hosted at <A HREF="https://github.com" target="_top">github.com</A>, and since github provides web page hosting facilities for its projects the online face of my work has moved away from RBJones.com.
    A brief guide to these projects and links to their repositories, wiki's and websites may be found at <A HREF="https://rbjones.github.io" target="_top">rbjones.github.io</A>.
