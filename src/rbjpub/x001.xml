    <p>
      I really don't have anything to show for almost a lifetime of thinking philosophically.
      I am still doing it, and still thinking about writing a book.
      The title changes from time to time.
      At present its called "Rationality and Democracy".
    </p><p>
      I have also had much the same lifetime of interest in formal logic, the automation of reasoning and its application to the automation of engineering design, most of which doesn't get much beyond fantasy.
      When the World Wide Web started I tried out by building this web site.
      It became my email address, and a location for me to dump my attempts at writing or formalising.
