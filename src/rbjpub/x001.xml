      This almost defunct website, which began as hapless explorations at the dawn of the World Wide Web continues to house my fragmentary attempts to do philosophy.
      After pretty much abandoning HTML/XML as a medium, for some time my efforts have been rendered as PDF files which fall into a two main directories.
      In one of these, which I called for some time my "shed", I did formal work using a tool I conceived and lead the development of some time ago called ProofPower.
    </p><p>
      I've pretty much given up on the formal stuff now, and write fragmentary prose essays or false starts at "books".
