A website in turmoil.

RBJones.com is a website learning to live in chaos.
</p>
<p>
After many years tinkering with this website, thinking of the enterprise as the gradual construction of a coherent and stable evolving structured philosophical synthesis, it has dawned on me (I resist the temptation to say "finally") that the essence of my pleasure in philosophy is in the dynamic, which I should therefore embrace and expose.
</p>
<p>
This is not dynamic flow instead of a static structure, but a dynamic consisting in the transformation of structures.

<p>
The descent into chaos began with the failure of one "neo-positivist" synthesis (that is, with my concluding that the structure I had in mind for this synthesis wouldn't do), and my subsequent decision to write about the transition to a new conception of the synthesis rather than just replace the old with the new. 
</p>
<p>
This eased me into a lot of meta-thinking about the style of philosophical writing I am engaged in, and this has for the moment pushed the search for a new synthesis into the background.
