This web site is my working space, in which, over a period of more than more than fifteen years, I have been seeking to articulate my own philosophical perspective.
My efforts have so far been spectacularly unsuccessful.
I have failed to capture in these writings anything at all close to my own evolving point of view.

<p>
This continuing failure spawns a succession of conceptions of the nature of my enterprise, which I might now describe as a succession of ideas on how I might unify the processes of thinking forward with one of expressing verbally.
The result of such a unification would be a period of time in which what I wrote came close to expressing what I thought, at least in those in certain domains which I think of as philosophical.
