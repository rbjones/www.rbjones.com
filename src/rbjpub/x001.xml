<secbody title="Some Changes in Progress">

<subsec title="Socratic Progress">
<p>
I was intent on making this web site a window on the progress in my current writing projects, and still am.
However, the progress I am making at present is rather Socratic, I am learning that I have not yet reached a sufficiently clear and precise conception of the projects to consider myself properly engaged in their implementation (even though I am now nine months on from my first ideas).
I do believe that I am close, but I know that such beliefs are often ill-founded.
</p><p>
So at present this site may be thought of as providing a glimpse of my thinking on a pair of closely coupled book writing projects on which I will properly launch just as soon as the ideas become sufficiently settled.

<subsec title="Changes (1)">
I have recently undertaken some significant changes to the main projects in progress on this site, which will take some time to effect.
The main thrust of these is:
<ul>
<li> firstly to make "metaphysical positivism" a more
purely analytic philosophical position, which primarily involves the excision of prescriptive elements (which are typical of positivistic philosophy).
</li><li>
secondly, the broadening of the accompanying material on the historical origins
from a history of philosophical logic embracing much metaphysics, to a history
of philosophical analysis.
This change will permit a fuller account of the origins of the analytic method at the center
of metaphysical positivism, and make the whole thing into a more interesting story.
</li>
</ul>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Changes (2)">
<p>
Further to "changes(1)" I have now a broader conception of method,
which will permit the analytic method to more fully describe both its
application in the writing of these two books and its application in
diverse other fields.
</p><p>
The "broader conception" involves the separation of the analysis more
thoroughly into two components, one concerned exclusively with
deduction and the construction of the contexts in which deduction can
rigourously be conducted (which we often call "models"), the other
with all other aspects of the analysis.
These are concerned with the relationship between the model and the
problem domain in which the model is intended to be applicable.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="Changes (3)">
<p>
This one is hot off the press (this morning's ideas, jemmied in for my monthly upload), and I hope will prove the last change in my core conception of the "Metaphysical Positivism" project.
</p>
<p>
It is just a step further in the direction I was heading, a clearer and richer conception of how to go about the excision of dogma.
The idea is to make everything comparative.
Instead of a single proposed neutral metaphysic, for which a case is given, we consider many metaphysics and ways in which they can be compared.
Though the neutral metaphysic remains a preference, I seek the objective comparisons with other metaphysics which bring out the grounds for that preference.

<subsec title="purpose">
<p>
My aim in this site is to give the reader a vivid sense of the dynamics
of my current philosophical projects.
</p><p>
I have two book-writing projects taking off right now, and every step along
these roads of discovery will be presented here on RBJones.com long before the
books ever appear in print.
</p><p>
The site also contains a variety of previous cogitations.
</p>
</subsec>
</sbcol>
<sbcol>
<subsec title="the books">
<p>
The first of these projects is to be entitled "Metaphysical Positivism" and
will be a new formulation of positivist philosophy.
The book is intended to be a prose volume of similar scale and character to
A.J.Ayer's "Language Truth and Logic".
However, the book is primarily a presentation of an analytic method.
It offers, rather than prescribes, a method, and provides analysis of that method,
rather than polemic in its favour or against other methods. 
</p><p>
The second, which provides both background for the former and an
extended exemplar of the method of analysis informally described in that book, will
be an analytic history of philosophical analysis, tracing the origins of our
method and exemplifying its use.
