My intellectual preoccupations are primarily philosophical, but also include the investigation of certain technical problems motivated by the philosophy.
My own manner of philosophising involves a great deal of thinking, not a lot of reading, nothing much like scholarship and lamentably little writing.
I don't aim to write papers for philosophical journals.
I would like to write a book, that is what my philosophical thinking is oriented towards, but it seems uncertain that I ever will.
</p><p>
I am hoping that my conception of what that book should be is beginning to stabilise.
The title I am working with is <xlink href="philos/x033.html">"Positive Philosophy and The Automation of Reason"</xlink>.

The best clues to the kind of project which interests me (at least so far as <i>analytic</i> philosophy is concerned) are the examples of Leibniz and Carnap.
Leibniz for his conception of <xlink href="philos/history/xh003.html">a Universal Characteristic with a Calculus Ratiocinator</xlink>, and Carnap for his dedication to pressing forward Russell's conception of a "Scientific Philosophy", based on modern logical methods, into new territory (the formalisation of philosophy and science).
In keeping with the latter example, I usually think of myself as a kind of positivist, in particular as a <i><xlink href="philos/x010.html">metaphysical positivist</xlink></i>.
My interests do go beyond purely <i>analytic</i> philosophy.
I call the broader conception <i><xlink href="x003.html">positive philosophy</xlink></i> (alternatively <xlink href="philos/x018.html">here</xlink> ), but it doesn't get a fair share of my brain.

On the technical side, I accept a fairly old fashioned conception of Cantorian theory of (well-founded) sets as a near-universal ultimate foundation for abstract semantics, but believe that a non-well founded ontology might be better as a near-universal logical context in which to formally develop mathematics and its applications.
Note here the talk of set theory as being logical, in keeping with a rather old fashioned (and unqualified) Carnapian logicism.
Obtaining the right kind of non-well-founded foundation system (<xlink href="pp/doc/t041.pdf">a strong illative lambda-calculus</xlink>) and doing the metatheory for it in a well-founded set theory is the principal present aim of my technical work.
</p>
<p>
I also do some formal exegesis of the work of other philosophers, perhaps that should count as "technical" (e.g.: <xlink href="pp/doc/t028.pdf">Aristotle</xlink>).
