Who is entitled to write his reminiscences?<br/>
Everyone.<br/>
Because noone is obliged to read them.<br/>
In order to write ones reminiscences it is not necessary to be a great man, nor a notorious criminal, nor a celebrated artist, nor a statesman - it is quite enough to be simply a human being, to have something to tell, and not merely to desire to tell it but at least have some little ability to do so.

Alexander Herzen, in <i>The Pole Star</i>,1855

<blockquote>
<p>
Herzen's point of view holds good for philosophy too.
</p><p>
In these pages there grows an account of a sceptical utopian philosophical system.
Because sceptical, it comes to no more than a structured collection of impressions, about how things are and how they might be.
The authors qualification is no more than that he aspires to an articulated point of view.
