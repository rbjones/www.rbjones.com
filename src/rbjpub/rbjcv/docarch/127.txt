\fBTHE LCF PARADIGM\fP




implement proof checker using
a TYPED FUNCTIONAL programming LANGUAGE
as META-LANGUAGE (e.g. SML)




abstract data type of THEOREMS
GUARANTEED SOUND by the type checker
(assuming the logic is well defined)




META-LANGUAGE is AVAILABLE TO the USER
for programming proofs and other customisation,
WITHOUT risk of COMPROMISING the CHECKER.

\fBSAFETY CRITERIA:\fP

.IP \(bu
PRESERVATION of ILL-TYPEDNESS
.IP \(bu
PRESERVATION of INVALIDITY

Translations are safe in both respects, except for treatment of partiality,
loose generics, tuples.

\fBCRITERIA of CORRECTNESS:\fP

.IP \(bu
PRESERVATION of WELL-TYPEDNESS
.IP \(bu
PRESERVATION of VALIDITY
.LP

This might be achievable with some adjustments to the semantics of Z!
A new parser/printer would be necessary.
.LP
We believe (without detailed study) that our translations are mostly SAFE,
but we have NOT attempted to achieve CORRECT translations.
