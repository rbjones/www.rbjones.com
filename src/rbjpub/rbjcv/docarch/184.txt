What kinds of justification are there?




Which justifications hold water?

\fBWHY DO WE CARE?\fP

.IP \(bu
\fBmethods work\fP

we are consulted on methods and have to present some arguments in favour of specific methodological proposals

.IP \(bu
\fBbroadening of customer base\fP

we are developing tools and will need to broaden our customer base to justify sustained development of these tools

.IP \(bu
\fBprofessional standards\fP

our reputation depends upon our self critical attitude to our work, this attitude must continue to apply to methods

.IP \(bu
\fBconsistency with tool standards\fP

we have taken particular care over the integrity and soundness of our proof tools; this is worthless unless we have confidence in the methods which they support

WEAKEST LINK\fP


FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEMS are MARGINAL


TOOL INTEGRITY PROBLEMS are SOLUBLE



TOOL PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS
are
NOT A SOURCE OF UNSOUNDNESS



METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS are SERIOUS



the EASIEST WAY to FAKE VERIFICATION is:

to solve FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEMS we
ADAPT techniques from (mathematical) LOGIC



to SCRUTINISE
the VALIDITY of proposed FORMAL METHODS
we should CAUTIOUSLY ADAPT
METHODS from ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY

Testing of Software
(in most cases)
cannot be exhaustive


Given a formal specification
a correct program
can be proven correct


The justification of this claim
