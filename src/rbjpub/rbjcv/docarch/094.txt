PRIMARY ISSUES (from proof-theoretic viewpoint)
.DS C



REFLEXIVE DOMAINS



TYPE INHERITANCE



FUNCTIONS SPACES
(continuity, strictness)



STRATIFICATION
(1, 2 or 3 layers)


When do we need to have these issues settled?

DIFFICULTIES WITH BQM MODEL
.DS C
Is it 2 or 3 layers?
(and why)

How does the record type constructor work
(proof of closure please)

Quantification and Continuity

CONTINUITY
.DS C
Identifying FORMULAE with
CONTINUOUS BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS
gives a logic with
NEGLIGIBLE expressive power.

QUANTIFICATION is NOT CONTINUOUS.

IMPLICTION is NOT MONOTONIC (or strict).

In the VDM RL semantics, specifications
which ought to denote discontinuous functions
simply fail to have models, they are inconsistent.

WHAT FUNCTION SPACE IS BEST?
.DS C

SCOTT CONTINUOUS?
No, continuity is too strong a constraint.
(for a specification language)


BLIKLE/Z PARTIAL FUNCTION SPACE.
(A pf B) = A \*(be B = {r | r\(ib \*m(A \(mu B) \*e r is many-one}
No, strictness is too strong a constraint.


KENTRIKOS PARTIAL FUNCTION SPACE
No, it doesn't admit closure.
(a little overpopulated)


ADD BOTTOMS and use TOTAL FUNCTIONS?
(A pf B) = (A+?)\(->(B+?)


RBJ PF SPACE?
(A pf B) = (A + \(es) \*(be (B - \(es)
