In Defence market:

ASSURANCE
is
ADDED VALUE


customer requirements go
BEYOND ZERO DEFECTS



customer (DOD, GCHQ/MOD) precisely defines
LEVELS of EVALUATION
(vide Orange book)
in which HIGHER LEVELS
DEMAND FORMAL VERIFICATION


use of FORMAL METHODS to achieve
HIGHER LEVELS of ASSURANCE
gives COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE and
creates NEW MARKETS

\fBSECURITY MODELLING\fP
.DE
.LP
Invitations to tender now frequently contain requirements for formal
security models.

.LP
The DS Development Unit provides formal presentations of security
requirements for inclusion in tender documents.

.LP
Further formal security modelling may be provided after award of contract.



.LP
Projects supported in this way include:

VME Security Option

UKAIR

PEOPLE

.DE
.LP
Very high calibre of staff required
Customer specifies PhD level staff.
.LP
Staff difficult to recruit,
and difficult to retain.
.DS C


LANGUAGES, METHODS and TOOLS

.DE
.LP
The technology is still immature.
Considerable productivity benefits
could be expected from improved tooling.
.LP
Higher levels of evaluation require 
better languages, methods and tools.
