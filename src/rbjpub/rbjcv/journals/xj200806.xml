I'm opening up this journal again because I'm trying (again) to do a book, but
I don't yet have a clear enough idea of the structure to actually get started
properly, and I need somewhere to write while I am getting to that point.
</p><p>
This isn't really an entirely <i>new</i> project, its a rolling together of all
the book ideas I have had over the past ten years.
The aim of the work is distinct however, and that will determine how much of
the previous material might possibly be relevant (though I don't plan to re-use
any of it).
</p><p>
This is a philosophical book project.
The single most important impediment to me getting anywhere with philosophy so
far has been that, on the one hand the definitely philosophical projects have
not seemed to me to be <i>important</i> enough, and the closest I had to
something important was the utopian ideas, which on the one hand were not
really sufficiently <i>philosophical</i> and on the other hand I didn't really
have clear enough ideas about how to write on that topic.
</p><p>
Also, as far as practical philosophy is concerned, ethics and politics, I
didn't feel that I had a good enough grounding.
Not that I feel I need much of a grounding!
So I have done a certain amount of reading to improve that situation a little.
That has been mainly Isaiah Berlin
