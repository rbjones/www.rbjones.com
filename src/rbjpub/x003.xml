<section title="Introduction">
<abstract>
It is a site of philosophical sketches.
At their more conservative these describe <i>metaphysical positivism</i> which is concerned centrally with deductive reason and analytic truth.
At an opposite extreme <i>existential positivism</i> extends a positivistic attitude to the consideration of the most important issues which face us, inaccessible though they are to deductive resolution.
In the middle ground we have a constructive if philosophical interest in the automation of deductive reason.

The rationale for my current conception of this, my personal website, is to be found in <i>existential positivism</i>.
The proximate provocation for existential positivism lies in the scientific evangelism of Richard Dawkins, who, perceiving an attack on rational science from fundamentalist religion has responded with a critique of faith (in general) and a defence of scientific rationality.
This seems to me too much like a conflict between different systems of institutionalised dogma for me to enroll on either side, but the battle lines drawn up by Dawkins have made me feel the need to state my own counter position to dogma of all kinds.
My position is rooted in a positive skepticism, for which the word <i>positivism</i>, coined by Auguste Comte is apt (even though positivisms have their dogmas).

<subsec>
I already was engaged in positivistic analytic philosophy, under the heading <i>metaphysical positivism</i>, which is at best tenuously relevant to present concerns.
I have opened up a second positivist front, more broadly scoped, under the heading <i>existential positivism</i>.
This is really no more than an account of my own personal belief system, extending to matters beyond the scope of analytic philosophy, taking a more definite stance on social, economic, political, moral, and of course existential concerns than could ever be justified analytically, and serving as an exemplar of the kinds of belief system which can sustain a sense of meaning and purpose in life in default of religious or other dogma.
