I think of myself primarily as a philosopher, with a measure of competence in
analytic philosophy but an inclination to consider other kinds of philosophy of
greater importance.
I am also logician, both philosophical and mathematical, and a musician.
Not any of these professionally.
<p/>
This web site is mainly a place where I do philosophy and logic, where pretty
much anything I write, meritorious or not, appears.
In this space I not only write for this hypermedium, but also am increasingly
focussed on producing more linear works for publication in hard copy.
This kind of material mostly appears as PDF documents in not so prominent
places, but I am at present trying to make the web site as a whole feel like a
place where new ideas are being woven into books before the eyes of the reader.
<p/>
This will be a lot easier to do when it really is the case, just now I am still
(I hope) in transition from a lengthy period of "philosophers block" into
something more eloquent.
