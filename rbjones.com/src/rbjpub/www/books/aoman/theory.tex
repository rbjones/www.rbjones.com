\section{Theoretical Philosophy}\label{theoretical}

I seek to present a fairly comprehensive philosophy in which a {\it theoretical} part underlies the {\it practical}.

By practical is meant, concerning action, and this includes ethics and politics and is our primary concern.
By theoretical is meant, concerning knowledge.

In recent times, theoretical philosophy has been wholly substantially analytic, and has taken language as fixed, and considered the truth of various propositions expressed in the given language (for example the English language).

We do not have to work in the context of some fixed language.
We may chose our language, and should do so carefully.
The will be pragmatic consequences of these choices, which may impact on our practical philosophy.

For example, if we there are natural differences in the methods appropriate for dealing with knowledge of certain different kinds, it will be helpful for our language to align precisely with these kinds of knowledge.
