\chapter{Philosophical Method}\label{Philosophy}

This book exemplifies a philosophical method, of which I propose in this chapter to give a first sketch.
The method is predicated upon certain fundamental beliefs which will be stated here with little explanation or justification.
Some of these will be discussed, and perhaps justified, in later chapters, but our most fundamental beliefs are the basis for justification of those less fundamental, and must stand on their own merits.

My first fundamental belief is that absolute certainty is not to be had.
I am a fallibilist.
If I also believed that absolute certainty were a condition of knowledge then I would be a complete skeptic.
I am instead skeptical about language, and doubt that the question whether absolute certainty is a condition of knowledge has a definite meaning or truth value.
