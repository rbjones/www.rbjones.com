\s+4\fBESTABLISHMENT of CONSISTENCY\fP\s-4



Formalise syntax


Formalise proof rules and axioms


Formalise semantics
(define validity)


Show that proof rules are sound
(preserve validity)


Show that axioms are valid


Show that "[]|-F" is not valid


Show that there exists a model?

\fBLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
for
CONSISTENCY PROOF\fP




All but last item 
(existence of model)
could be done in HOL.


Last could be done in ZF-HOL
or else reduce to simplest form
and leave unproven.

\fBEMBEDDING of FRAGMENTS
of SML into HOL\fP



identify semantics domains
(need not have single type
per syntactic category)


simplified way of doing
denotational semantics


No need to formalise syntax
