A small formal methods group has been established over the last two years in
ICL defence systems.  The group has given attention to various problems in
formal specification, verification and in logical foundations.  A presentation
will be given at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory at 4 p.m.
on March 26th 1987, giving an overview of the work of the group with particular
emphasis on applications of HOL.
