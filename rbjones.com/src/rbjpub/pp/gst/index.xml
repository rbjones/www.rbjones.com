Galactic Set Theory and some applications.
"Galactic" set theory is basically a higher-order set theory in which every set is a member of a "galaxy" and every galaxy is a model of ZFC.
(galaxies are what Grothendieck called "universes", which is obviously a misnomer, you can't have more than one universe can you?)
